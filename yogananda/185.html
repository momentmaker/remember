  With golden plumes of spiritual unfoldment, with the softest down of tender feeling, and decked out in a costume of
  color and graceful beauty, I am Thy soul-bird of paradise. My wings, sped by the eager desire to progress, beat their
  way through lifeâ€™s somber skies in continuous search of the paradise of peace.<br>
  <br>
  Despondency has sometimes daubed dark colors on the fragile feathers of my bright, sunny mind.<br>
  <br>
  Oh! Bathe me, Thy bird of paradise, with the cleansing sun-rays of insight, and soothe me with Thy soft-singing
  melodies of peace.

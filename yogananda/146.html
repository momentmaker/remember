<div id="y146">
  Fierce foes and obstinate, idle habits of restlessness have often entrenched themselves in the territory of my heart.
  Let me defeat them all, bent as they are on robbing me of my wealth of inner peace. Lead Thou my forces of calmness
  victoriously to the divine kingdom of fulfillment.

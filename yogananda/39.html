<div id="y39">
  In Thy temples, when many come to pray, I take God-intoxication from their eyes. I blend them together into a
  cocktail of devotion. I serve that nectar to my thirsty thoughts, and they drink and drink, forgetting all their
  wounds and worries.<br>
  <br>
  In the home of the materially rich but spiritually poor, I serve only this magic cocktail. I pour it into their dry
  vessels, empty of generosity, with my heartâ€™s good-will and sincerity.<br>
  <br>
  I pray that all who drink this nectar may become so intoxicated with inner bliss that they forget their slumber of
  ignorance forevermore.

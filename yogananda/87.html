<div id="y87">
  O Father, from joy I came; for joy I live; in joy will I melt again! Thou art sacred, perennial joy. Thou art the joy
  I seek. Thou art the everlasting joy of the soul. Teach me to worship Thee through the joy born of meditation. Balance
  my worship with good action, and teach me to shun all false pleasures which, siren-like, call to me through my
  misguided senses.

<div id="y78">
  Thou art the Supreme Spirit; I am made in Thine image. Thou art the Father, owner of the whole universe. I, good or
  naughty, am Thy child, and when I behave I have the right of possession over all that is Thine. Alas! I have played
  the truant, wandering away from Thy home of cosmic plenty. Lead me home again. Teach me to identify my highest
  interests with Thy will. Rescue me from this shipwreck on the tiny island of my body. Expand my consciousness; help me
  to understand once more that I am made in Thy image. When by Thy grace I discover that I, like Thee, am omnipresent,
  then at last shall I have true dominion over all things, even as Thou hast.

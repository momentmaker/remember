<div id="y119">
  Father Divine, banish me not in silence. I stand lonely without Thee. Let me not become imprisoned in my work, so that
  I forget Thee. I will go within, in meditation, to bring Thee without into the marketplace of life. Wherever Thou dost
  place me, there must Thou come. Hidden within the ashes of my burnt sadness, I shall find Thy golden presence.

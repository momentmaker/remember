  I found myself suffocating in the dark vapors of worldly ambition as my vessel sailed over life’s seas. Fearful of
  dying in delusion, I sought out and boarded the submarine of deep dedication, and dove deep into my inner self. In the
  silent depths of Thy consciousness I saw, at first shimmering before me, a light which spoke to me of fulfillments
  never before dreamed of.<br>
  <br>
  Diving deeper still, the submarine of my mind moved into astral seas—so rarely plumbed!—in search of Thee. Suddenly,
  probing with searchlight vision, my soul-submarine found itself in a new universe! I was surrounded on all sides by a
  mystic, flaming radiance. Overwhelmed by Thy supernal blessings, I beheld and reveled in Thy presence everywhere.

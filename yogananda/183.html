  I have heard Thy voice, Divine Mother, saying: “You have long remained enclosed in the cocoon of wrong human habits.
  Come out! ere the silk-man, Death, come to destroy you! Cut away the delusive, comfort-inducing silken cords of past
  habits which hold you, falsely secure, in their chamber of death.<br>
  <br>
  “Come out! Cease being a blind human worm sleeping and dreaming human weakness. Come out of your ages-old cocoon of
  delusion! Spread wings of eternal power and splendor, through spiritualizing your ambitions.<br>
  <br>
  “Come out! Be the butterfly of eternity! Let your wings display their innate divine beauty. Let them spread out over
  all space, entertained by and entertaining everything, everywhere.<br>
  <br>
  “On wings of beauty, fly through the skies of infinity, attracting all toward everything that is most beautiful.
  Sun-and-stardust, glimmering on your wings, banish gloom from every heart as you soar past on your joyous way to
  your home in Me, O butterfly of eternity!”

<div id="y65">
  The kingdom of my mind is cluttered with the trash of delusion. Pour down showers of Thy power, that my capital city,
  Discrimination, be no longer mud-strewn due to spiritual carelessness. Send streams of mercy inundating and washing
  away the filth of ignorance within myself. Let the downpouring of Thy love cleanse dirty streets of race, color, and
  class prejudice. Bathe my untidy children of lingering prejudice in the waters of Thy wisdom.<br>
  <br>
  Cover every dark path of my life with rose-carpets of Thy love. Inhaling Thy fragrance, and treading softly on a
  cushion of blossoms, I will run with hastening footsteps to Thy palace of perfection.

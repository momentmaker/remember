  I will sing a song uninfluenced by the voice of any other. I will offer Thee my own pristine heart-melodies.<br>
  <br>
  I will sing Thee a song unheard by any. I have nurtured this song-child myself; now I bring it to Thee for higher
  training.<br>
  <br>
  I will offer Thee no intellectual, premeditated, art-disciplined song. What I will offer Thee are the wild songs of my
  heart. I will offer Thee not civilized, emotion-packed music or artfully cultivated song-flowers, but wild blossoms
  that grow on the high hills of my soul.

<div id="y131">
  Open my inner eye, O Fountain of Light, that I may behold Thee in the dance of the myriad-hued atoms. Burst open the
  doors of space that I may see Thee behind the swirling mists of material illusion. Behind Thy walls of brilliant
  cosmic rays, Thou art hiding. Open every portal in Nature, that I may see Thee everywhere.

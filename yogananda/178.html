  When Thou camest, I smiled in my soul-cottage by the little brook of life. O Mystic Electrician, the many-tinted bulbs
  of unawakened happiness, long dependent on my nerve-clogged senses, refused to scintillate with light. For the
  nerve-wires had been torn and shaken by high winds of outward involvement. O Thou Silent Physician of Illness! Heal my
  tattered nerves! Restorer of shining currents in our lives, resurrect all the dead nerve-wires not only in me, but in
  people everywhere. Breathe into their bodies an unleashed flow of power, that all the unlit, bare-wired and dangling
  bulbs of their senses may suddenly shine again with Thy blazing glory.<br>
  <br>
  I am but the bulb: Thou art the holy energy that can animate it. Thou art, indeed, both bulb and light. Help all men
  to realize this miracle!<br>
  <br>
  Heal all our shattered nerves, and flood all the disease-clogged wires leading to those bulbs with the effulgence of
  Thy divine light.

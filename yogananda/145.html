<div id="y145">
  O King of Kingsâ€”train Thou in me, in the camp of discipline, the noble qualities of calmness and self-control. Be Thou
  their Divine General, like Krishna of yore, against the invading hordes of darkness, passion, and greed. Protect the
  celestial kingdom of my mind against entry by the tenacious warriors of evil. Let Thy banner of peace wave always
  above the strong castle of my soul.

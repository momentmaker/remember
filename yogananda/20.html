<div id="q20">
  You won’t find the Divine Spirit by making constant excuses:<br>
  for example, saying,<br>
  ‘When I find a quiet place, I will meditate.’<br>
  That is not at all the way to get there!<br>
  If you tell yourself, however,<br>
  “Right now I will plunge into deep meditation!”<br>
  you can be there in a moment.<br>
  When you are really sleepy,<br>
  you have no difficulty in sleeping no matter where you are.<br>
  When a person is in love,<br>
  he or she finds no difficulty in thinking of the beloved;<br>
  rather, it is difficult not to think of him or her,<br>
  even to the point of ignoring work.<br>
  Be in love with God!<br>
  It is easy to meditate deeply,<br>
  when your love for the Divine is deep enough.

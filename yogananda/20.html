<div id="y20">
  O God my Father, teach me to make a bouquet of the variously hued flowers of filial, conjugal, friendly, parental,
  and guru-disciple love, and to lay it reverently upon the altar of my heart, where Thou reignest supreme. If I am
  unable to tie all those flowers into one bouquet, I will pluck the rarest rose of love growing in the garden of my
  devotion, and lay that one flower at Thy feet. Oh! Wilt Thou receive it?

  Our One Father, we are traveling by many true paths toward Thy one abode of Light. Show us the one highway of common
  realization, where all bypaths of theological beliefs meet. Make us feel that the diverse religions are branches of
  Thy one tree of truth. Bless us, that we enjoy the intuition-tested, ripe, luscious fruits of self-knowledge hanging
  from the many branches of true scriptural teachings. In Thy one temple of silence we all sing to Thee a chorus of
  many-voiced religions. Teach us to chant in harmony with Thy loveâ€™s manifold expressions, that our chorus of souls
  rouse Thee to break Thy vow of cosmic silence and lift us onto Thy lap of universal, immortal understanding.

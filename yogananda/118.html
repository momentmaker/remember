<div id="y118">
  O Father, my little prayers are all roused in reverence, waiting for Thee. My little joys dance in tune with the
  temple-bells of inner harmony. The muffled drum of my craving beats deeply for Thee. My passion and my ignorance
  wait tremblingly to be sacrificed on Thine altar. I shall say my prayers with mystic beads made of my crystal
  teardrops, and polished with my love for Thee. I shall cleanse the altar of my heart with my repentance. Come! I long
  for Thy presence!

<div id="y26">
  O Krishna, Lord of Hindustan, I sorrowed by the lonely Jumna river, where Thy flute-notes thrilled the air and led
  lost calves to their divine home. O Lotus of Love, musing on the sad absence of Thy delusion-dispelling eyes, I saw
  Thine invisible Spirit take form, frozen by my devotionâ€™s frost.<br>
  <br>
  Thy divine body of sky-blue light walked with feet of eternity on the banks of my mind, planting there the lasting
  footprints of divine realization. I am one of those lost calves which followed Thy flower-footprints on the shoals of
  time. Listening to the melody of Thy flute of wisdom, I now follow the middle path of calm activity by which Thou
  hast led many through the portals of their dark past into the Eternal Light.<br>
  <br>
  Since all souls belong to Thy fold, whether we move forward, are sidetracked, or are hemmed in, unmoving, in the fogs
  of disbelief, O Divine Christna, lead us back to Thy enfolding shed of everlasting freedom. O Krishna, Thou
  reignest supreme on the heart-throne of all those who know Thy love.

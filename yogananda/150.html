<div id="y150">
  I am lost, Father, in the wastelands of wrong beliefs. Where is my home? I have kept the doors of my soul always open,
  expecting Thee. Ah! I have not yet found Thee. Rise high in the sky to illuminate my darkness: Be the Polestar to my
  searching mind, directing me to Thyself. For therein, I know, lies my home!

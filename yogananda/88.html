<div id="y88">
  O Spirit, teach me to enjoy Thee in spirit, that I may enjoy the world and my earthly duties with Thy joy. O Spirit,
  help me to train my senses, that they enjoy only good things. Teach me to enjoy earthly pleasures with Thy joy. Save
  me above all from the slightest touch of negativity, doubt, and cynicism.

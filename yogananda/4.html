<div id="y4">
  O Heavenly Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved God, may the halo of Thy presence spread over all minds.<br>
  <br>
  May the religion of matter-worship be converted into loving, direct worship of Thee. Since, without Thy power to
  love, we cannot truly love anything, may we love Thee first and above everything else. May the heavenly kingdom of
  Bliss, where Thou dwellest, manifest itself with all its divine qualities on earth, and may all lands be freed from
  limitations, imperfections, and miseries. Let Thy kingdom within us manifest itself without.<br>
  <br>
  Father, leave us not in the pit of temptations, into which we fell by the misuse of Thy gift of reason. When we become
  freer and stronger — should it be Thy wish to test us, to see whether we love Thee more than any temptation — then,
  Father, make Thyself more tempting than temptation! O Father, if it be Thy wish to test us, help us keep our will
  power strong enough to meet all Thy tests.<br>
  <br>
  Give us our daily bread: food, health, and prosperity for the body; efficiency for the mind; and, above all, Thy
  wisdom and love for our souls. Teach us to deliver ourselves, with Thy help, from the meshes of ignorance which we
  have woven through our own carelessness.

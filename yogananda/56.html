  Wandering through forests of incessant searching, I arrived at the mystery door which conceals Thy presence. I knocked
  loudly on this door of silence, with persistent blows of faith. At last, the door opened and I beheld Thee, resting,
  on Thy altar of glorious visions.<br>
  <br>
  I stood with restless gaze, waiting for Thee to speak. Thy creation-making voice was inaudible. At last a deep
  stillness stole upon me and taught me in whispers the language of angels. With the lisping voice of my new-born
  freedom I tried to speak. Suddenly the lights in Thy temple wrote brilliantly in letters of light.<br>
  <br>
  In my little chamber of quietness I am ever at rest. I never speak now, but with the voice of silence. Through my
  silence, O Divine Lover, converse Thou eloquently with me.

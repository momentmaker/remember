  Thou hast come into my temple at last. The doors of my senses are open wide. The bird of darkness has taken wing. I
  tune the harp-strings of my heart and sing a song of my ages-old love for Thee. My song will be newly costumed with
  the fresh notes of my soul.<br>
  <br>
  Wavelets of my song will dance in rhythm within the heaving of Thy great ocean of cosmic consciousness. Growing to
  great billows of devotion, they will move steadily to Thy shore.<br>
  <br>
  O lullaby of all soothing, rising, crashing waves, sing to me the song of my beloved Mother, Eternity.<br>
  <br>
  O anthem of divine love, rock me sonorously in thy cradle of cosmic vibration, and bring all my restless delusions to
  sleep at last on Thy great bosom of peace.

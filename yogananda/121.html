<div id="y121">
  Will that day dawn for me, O Divine Mother, when uttering Thy name will bring floods of tears, to inundate the
  drought-land of my heart and burst open the dark gates of my ignorance? Oh, then, in the lake of my gathered tears
  will grow the lotus of luminous wisdom: All darkness in my mind will be dispelled. O formless, all-pervading Mother
  Divine, come to me in the form of tangible kindness! Take me away from these shores of millennial sadness.

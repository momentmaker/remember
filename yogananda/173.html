<div id="y173">
  As we rest in sleep, wake in the morning to our daily round of desperate-seeming, but only half-conscious, activity,
  then fall back to sleep again at night—so also do we pass fleetingly from birth to life to death again, waking ever
  and again in new bodies, dashing about our appointments and other commitments, delighting in them or groaning at
  their importunity, then finding ourselves forced to leave everything at death’s next summons: dream after dream of
  ceaseless earthly struggles!<br>
  <br>
  On the sleigh of incarnations we find ourselves sliding by hopes and disappointments; victories and failures;
  fulfillments and disillusionments. When the smooth snow of easy passage melts, and the underlying ice of insecurity
  breaks, we find ourselves plunged into heaving seas: eddies of gay then desperate laughter; Sargassos of cloying
  involvements; vast calms of indifference—ah! all, only dreams!<br>
  <br>
  When at last I awoke in Thee, I discovered that I’d been dreaming all along! I’d only thought I was awake.

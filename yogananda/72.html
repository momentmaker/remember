  Every sound that I make, let it have the vibration of Thy voice. Every thought that I think, let it be saturated with
  the consciousness of Thy presence.<br>
  <br>
  Let every feeling that I have glow with Thy love. Let every act of my will be impregnated with Thy divine vitality.
  Let every thought, every expression, every ambition, be ornamented by Thee.<br>
  <br>
  O Divine Sculptor, chisel Thou my life according to Thy design!

<div id="y50">
  O Silent Laughterâ€”smile Thou through my soul. Let my soul smile through my heart. And let my heart smile through my
  eyes.<br>
  <br>
  O Prince of Smiles! Be Thou enthroned beneath the canopy of my countenance, safe in the castle of my sincerity, where
  no rebel hypocrisy can lurk to destroy Thy presence in me.<br>
  <br>
  Make me a smile-millionaire, that I may scatter Thy rich smiles freely upon sad hearts everywhere!

  O heavenly Trinity—Om, Tat, Sat —: God the transcendent Father, God the immanent Christ consciousness, and God the
  Holy, Creative, Vibratory Force of all Creation! Grant me the wisdom to know Thy truth! Through my self-effort and my
  knowing acceptance of the law, help me up the golden ladder of realization, to stand at last on the shining summit
  of attainment, face to face with the One Spirit: Perfect, Everlasting Bliss!

  O Father, Thou art just behind my vision with which I see Thy beauty without. Thou art just behind my listening power
  with which I hear Thy voice in all Creation. Thou art just behind my touch with which I feel Thy world. In the
  sweetness of flowers and in the zest of sustaining food lies hidden the essence of Thy being: Thine eternal
  sweetness. Thou art just behind the voice of my prayer. Thou art just behind the mind with which I pray. Thou art just
  behind my glistening feelings. Thou art just behind my thoughts. Thou art just behind my cravings for Thee. Thou art
  just behind my meditations. Thou art just behind the veil of Natureâ€™s splendors. Thou art just behind the screen of my
  love. Behind all these mystic screens, reveal Thyself as Thou art!

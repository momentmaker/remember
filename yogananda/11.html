<div id="y11">
  With the opening of the earliest dawn and the lotus-buds, my soul softly opens in prayer to receive Thy light. Bathe
  each petal of my mind with Thy radiant rays! I saturate myself with the perfume of Thy presence, and I wait to waft
  with the breeze the aroma of Thy message of love to all. Bless me, that with the spreading dawn I may spread Thy love
  everywhere. Bless me, that with the awakening dawn I may awaken all souls with my own and bring them to Thee.

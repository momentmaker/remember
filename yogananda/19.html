<div id="q19">
  The Divine Spirit answers all prayers.<br>
  Restless prayers, however,<br>
  He answers only a little bit.<br>
  If you offer to others something that isn’t yours to give,<br>
  won’t that be a merely empty gesture?<br>
  If you pray... similarly,<br>
  but lack control over your own thoughts,<br>
  that prayer will be without power.<br>
  Thoughts and feelings, both,<br>
  must be focused when you pray.<br>
  Otherwise God will meet your little trickle with another trickle in return!<br>
  Answers will be doled out to you in a teaspoon.<br>
  Too often, prayer is more like the halfhearted mumbling of a beggar than the confident,<br>
  loving demand of a friend.

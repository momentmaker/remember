  O Divine Mother, teach me to use the gift of Thy love, which I feel in my heart, to love the members of my family more
  than myself. Bless me, that I may love my neighbors more than my family. Expand my heartâ€™s feelings, that I love my
  country more than my neighbors, and my world and all my human brethren more than my country, neighbors, family, and my
  own self.<br>
  <br>
  Lastly, teach me to love Thee more than anything else, for it is only Thy love that enables me to love everything.
  Without Thee, I could not love anything or anybody.<br>
  <br>
  Father Divine, teach me to enter through the portals of family love, and that of the love of my friends, into the
  mansion of wider social love. Teach me to pass from there through the doors of social love, and into the wider
  mansion of international love. Then teach me to pass through the portals of international love into the endless
  territory of divine love, wherein I perceive all animate and inanimate objects as breathing and living by Thy love
  alone.<br>
  <br>
  Teach me to tarry not at any alluringly beautiful gate of family, social, or international love. Teach me to pass
  through all portals that lead to the smaller gardens of love until, passing through the last gate of human love, I
  enter into the endless territory of divine love where I shall find all living, semi-living, and sleeping things to be
  my very own.

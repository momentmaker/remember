  I tell my prayers on the beads of love, strung with my devotion. I direct them beyond all names—God, Spirit, Brahma,
  Christ, Shankara, Krishna, Buddha, Mohammed—for all names are Thine. And I shun no name, for I know Thou dwellest in
  all forms.<br>
  <br>
  In Thy cosmic dramas on the stage of time, and in Thy myriad acting roles, Thou hast assumed innumerable names. Behind
  them all, too, I know Thy one, changeless name: Eternal, Conscious, Self-existent Bliss.<br>
  <br>
  Many times have I played with Thee. Many songs of Thine have I sung. On the ocean-bosom of Thy eternal life I’ve been
  nurtured by Thee as a tiny drop of life. I remember Thy warm touch through the centuries whenever, feeling the chill
  of separation, I turned homeward to Thee. Again, in this daylight of remembrance, let me play with Thee. Let me sing
  Thy songs.

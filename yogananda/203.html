  Our One Father, we are traveling by many true paths to Thy one abode of Supreme Truth. Help us to understand that the
  diverse religions are all branches on Thy one tree of truth. Bless us, that we may enjoy the intuition-tested, ripe
  and luscious fruits of self-knowledge that hang from every branch of true scriptural teachings.<br>
  <br>
  Thy temple is but one: Its name is Silence. In it we sing Thee a combined chorus of many religions. Teach us to chant
  together in harmony! May the combined expressions of our love for Thee make Thee break Thy silence and lift us up, as
  a Mother does Her children, onto Thy lap of universal understanding and immortality. Sing along with us to confirm
  Thy acceptance of our chants to Thee.

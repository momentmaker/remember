  I looked at a flower and prayed: suddenly, O Father, I beheld Thee hiding there. It exuded to me the perfume of Thy
  presence. I saw the blush of Thy purity coloring its petals. It was the gold of Thy wisdom that shone in its heart.
  Thine all-embracing, upholding power filled its delicate calyx. The mystery of life and immortality lay in the
  pollenâ€”lifted by the bee when it tasted Thy sweetness. Oh teach me Thy wonders of Creation, which are hinted at in
  even the tiniest roadside weed.

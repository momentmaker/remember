  I withdrew the life force from my body. The breath, which had kept me tied to the burden of flesh, no longer shook my
  awareness. My rocket of life penetrated through the star in the all-seeing eye of light in my forehead. The rocket
  soared outward, its cone of focused concentration and deep feeling exploded to oneness with the countless atoms of
  space, and with the little points of self-awareness in all beings. At last, like an expanding cloud-nebula, I
  embraced the vast Spirit beyond space itself, to enter the heart of Thine omnipresent silence!

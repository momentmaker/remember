<div id="y219">
  Mother Divine, make me love equally every friend in my life. By loving them may I find Thy love in all hearts,
  everywhere. Teach me to return even greater love to those who love me, and to pray also, and even especially, for
  those who do not love me. I will secretly enjoy loving them, for they, too—though they know it not!—are my brothers
  and sisters in God.

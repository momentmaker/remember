<div id="y116">
  O Father, I hold my heart in my folded hands. Teach me to saturate my prayers with Thy love. Give me the simple,
  sincere devotion toward Thee of a child. Teach me to realize Thee just behind the voice of my prayer. Teach me to
  feel Thy breath flowing with my breath. Teach me to cognize Thy presence in my emotions. Teach me to perceive Thy
  wisdom in my understanding. Teach me to sense Thy all-pervading life in my life. Oh! flood my senses with Thy light.

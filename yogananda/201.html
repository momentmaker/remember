<div id="y201">
  I take this sacred vow: Never will I lower my love’s gaze below the eyebrow-horizon of my constant thoughts of Thee!
  Never will I turn my uplifted inner sight away from Thee! Never will I let my mind dwell on anything that reminds me
  not of Thee! I will disdain the nightmare of ignorant behavior. I will court all dreams of noble achievement: those
  of love, kindness, and understanding, for they are Thy dreams.<br>
  <br>
  Though I dream many dreams, wakefully I will ever think of Thee. In the sacred fire of constant remembrance, kept ever
  alight on my soul’s altar, I will ever behold Thy presence with the watchful eyes of devotional love.<br>
  <br>
  Thy grace has shown me that the dualities of health and sickness, life and death, joy and sorrow are but passing
  fantasies. I am finished with those eternally self-canceling delusions! I am persuaded at last that there is but one
  abiding reality: Thy eternal, ever-conscious, ever-new, ever-thrilling, infinite Bliss.

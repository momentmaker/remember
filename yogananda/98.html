<div id="y98">
  Today, Father, Thou hast come into my temple. With Thy coming all the lights of my sense-servants have sprung to
  life and the door of my heart has been opened wide. Thy blessing has driven away the darkness of ages, sending its
  heavy vapors fleeing at the first glimpse of Thy approach. The loud-beating drums of my craving announced Thy
  manifestation. The incense of devotion, rising from the incensor of my soul, wafts upward to Thee. Oh, bless me
  always! Respond to me whenever I call to Thee.

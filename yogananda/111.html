<div id="y111">
  Teach me, O Father, to find Thee in the cave of my heart, that I may walk with Thee everywhere. Teach me to hear Thee
  in silence, that I may hear Thy voice beneath outer noises. Teach me to find Thee in inner peace, that I may be with
  Thee calmly in the midst of outer tumult. Hubbub or silence, tumult or peace: I care not, so as long as Thou wilt
  teach me to find Thee anywhere, at any time.

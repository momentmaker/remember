<div id="y17">
  Teach me, O Spirit, by meditation, to stop the storm of breath, the skipping of my mental restlessness, and all the
  sensory disturbances that rage on the lake of my mind. Let the magic wand of my intuition halt the gale of passions
  and unnecessary desires. In the rippleless lake of my mind, then, let me behold the undistorted reflection of the moon
  of my soul, glistening ever with the reflected light of Thy presence.

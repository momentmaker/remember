<div id="q17">
  Meditate regularly,<br>
  and you will find a joy inside that is real.<br>
  You will then have something you can compare to sense pleasures.<br>
  That comparison will automatically make you want to forsake your sorrow-producing bad habits.<br>
  The best way to overcome temptation is to have something more fulfilling to compare it with.

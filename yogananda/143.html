<div id="y143">
  I may lose everything, and roam about in darkness, but O Divine Mother! see that the tiny taper of my remembrance
  for Thee be not extinguished by the gusts of disbelief. I loved many things only to find that my true craving was for
  Thee alone. Come to me now! Be with me always!

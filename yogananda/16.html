<div id="y16">
  O Conscious Cosmic Energy, Thou alone dost directly support my body. Solid, liquid, and gaseous foods are converted
  and spiritualized into energy by Thy cosmic energy. That energy supports my body. Help me to learn, O Spirit, to
  live more and more by direct cosmic energy, and less and less by food. Thine energy burns in the bulbs of my five
  senses. I recharge myself with Thine omnipresent, cosmic energy.

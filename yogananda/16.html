<div id="q16">
  Don’t waste the perception of the God’s presence,<br>
  acquired in meditation,<br>
  by useless chatting.<br>
  Idle words are like bullets:<br>
  they riddle the milk pail of peace.<br>
  In devoting time unnecessarily to conversation and exuberant laughter,<br>
  you’ll find you have nothing left inside.<br>
  Fill the pail of your consciousness with the milk of meditative peace,<br>
  then keep it filled.<br>
  Joking is false happiness.<br>
  Too much laughter riddles the mind and lets the peace in the bucket flow out,<br>
  wasting it.

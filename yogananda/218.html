<div id="y218">
  Dear God, I know that Thou art Love, because my mother and my father love me; Thou art my eternal Father and Mother.
  My friends love me with Thy love, in their hearts. Thou art my best of all friends. Thou art my Teacher through all
  that happens to me in life. Because Thou lovest me, teach me to love Thee.

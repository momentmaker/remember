<div id="q10">
  Meditate more and more deeply,<br>
  until calmness and joy become second nature to you.<br>
  To be ecstatic is not difficult.<br>
  It is thinking that it is difficult that holds you apart from it.<br>
  Never think of divine joy as distant from you,<br>
  and it will be with you always.<br>
</div>

<div id="y10">
  O Father, when I was blind I found not a door which led to Thee, but now that Thou hast opened my eyes I find doors
  everywhere: through the hearts of flowers, through the voice of friendship, through sweet memories of all lovely
  experiences. Every gust of my prayer opens a new door in the vast temple of Thy presence.

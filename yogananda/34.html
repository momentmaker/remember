<div id="y34">
  I have burnt my past, destroying every seed of evil destiny. I have stridden bravely through the strewn ashes of my
  past and future fears.<br>
  <br>
  I am the Eternal NOW, having torn to shreds my enclosing cocoon of ignorance with the sharp knife of free will.<br>
  <br>
  Now I am Thy soaring butterfly of eternity, flitting freely through immeasurable skies of time. The beauty of my wings
  I spread out through Nature everywhere, to entertain all beings. My wings are sprinkled with suns and stardust. Lo! I
  am beautiful! May every silken thread that shrouded my past folly be severed forever. See! They trail now behind me,
  only adding to my beauty as I wing my way to my own Self in Thee.

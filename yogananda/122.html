<div id="y122">
  O All-Pervading Spirit, the breeze of Thy inspiration has removed every cloud from my heart. The firmament of my
  mind is now clear. Purified, I behold only Thee, everywhere. The sunshine of Thy joy spreads rapidly to the farthest
  shores of my being. After long ages of hunger, I feed on Thy light. By Thy grace, and by my constant wakefulness in
  Thee, may this joy be mine forever, forever, and forever!

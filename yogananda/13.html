<div id="y13">
  The day is done. Refreshed and sanctified with the sunshine of the day I pass through the portals of evening, dimly
  adorned with faint stars, to enter into the temple of silence and worship Thee. I worship Thy Spirit of approaching
  calmness. What prayers can I offer? For I have no words to offer Thee. I shall light a little fire of devotion on the
  altar of my soul. Will that light suffice to bring Thee into my dark temple â€” my dimly lighted temple, dark with my
  ignorance? Come! I crave, I yearn for Thee!

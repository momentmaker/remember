<div id="q13">
  In meditation,<br>
  you must go beyond thought.<br>
  As long as you are busy thinking,<br>
  you are in your rational mind,<br>
  on the conscious plane.<br>
  When you sleep and dream,<br>
  you are on the subconscious plane.<br>
  And when your mind is fully withdrawn in superconsciousness,<br>
  it becomes centered in the bliss of the spine.<br>
  That is the level of the soulâ€™s existence.

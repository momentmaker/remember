<div id="y37">
  Into the temple of peace come Thou, O God of joy! Into the shrine of my devotion, come!<br>
  <br>
  O Bliss-God! Sanctify the sanctuary of my goodness by Thy presence.<br>
  <br>
  O mighty Allah, hover above Thy solitary minaret of waiting expectations. Lo! the mosque of my mind exudes the
  frankincense of perfect stillness.<br>
  <br>
  Come, Lord! I am listening for the silent tread of Thy footsteps. In the temple of my self-unfoldment I await Thy
  coming.<br>
  <br>
  Into the invisible temple of my prayer, built of shining, crystal blocks of devotion, come Thou daily and receive the
  humble offerings of my heart, renewed constantly by love.

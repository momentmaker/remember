<div id="y77">
  O Eternal Fire, Thou art the little soul-flames rising through the burner of cosmic manifestation. Each human being is
  but one flame, separate-seeming from all others, and also from Thy Universal Source of Power. Thou dost appear many,
  finite, limited, small or large, but ever divided, shooting up as separate entities through the pores of living
  organisms. But Thou alone art that one, eternal flame. All things other are but Thy multifarious appearances.

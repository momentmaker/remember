<div id="y186">
  Miles and miles of eternity I traversed, humming Thy name, seeking the garden of my dreams.<br>
  <br>
  I am Thy tiny hummingbird, busily fluttering the wings of activity in service to Thee. I must travel far to find Thy
  rare orchid blossoms, and to revel in a symphony of color on far mountain slopes of my dreams.<br>
  <br>
  I am Thy busy hummingbird, ever humming Thy name, dipping my long beak deep into the feeling heart of all
  soul-qualities: golden, blue, marigold, and flowers of many hues. By Thy grace, may I not, inadvertently, sip any
  bitter honey of evil.<br>
  <br>
  I am Thy tiny hummingbird, buzzing with Thy unceasing vitality, sipping from all the blossoms in Thy fragrant garden
  of sweet joy, and in the humblest wayside plots of all human sweetness.

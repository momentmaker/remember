<div id="y137">
  Intoxicate me with devotionâ€™s wine. I will drink of Thee until death. My earthly desires are now dead, and I will
  live in Thee forever. A thrilling current runs through each cell of my body, and through every opening of my love for
  Thee. Saturated with devotion, I will enter the heaven of Thy presence. Groping blindly, the urge of my devotion
  suddenly flings open the secret door in my soul: Oh, what bliss I feel on beholding Thy light!

<div id="y205">
  Flowers, cloud-scattered skies, and all beautiful, blossoming scenery: all these only suggest Thy divinity. I enjoy
  themâ€”I revel in them!<br>
  <br>
  But then they remind me of Thee. In that remembrance, these mere (though glorious) messengers vanish, and the beauty
  of my own beloved Infinity enthralls me.

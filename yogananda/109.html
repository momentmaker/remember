<div id="y109">
  O Father, if Thou wakest me, how can I ever sleep again? If sleep should steal upon me, wilt Thou awake me? The
  terrors lurking in the dream-jungle of life are now forgotten. My sorrow has, by Thy grace, been changed into tears of
  joy. All my tiny, emotional joys blaze into bliss. My body-temple is filled with Thy light: Its rays keep the eyes of
  my wisdom from drooping. I thank Thee, Father, for keeping me always awake and ready!

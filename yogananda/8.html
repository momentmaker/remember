<div id="y8">
  Bearing the bliss of Brahma, happiness supreme; wearing the image of wisdom; beyond the dispute of any qualities; free
  as the limitless sky; Knower of all there is to be known: Thou perennial, taintless one, Witness of all happenings,
  beyond all conceptions’ boundaries, uncolored by good, bad, and active qualities: my ever-awake Preceptor — I bow to
  Thee!

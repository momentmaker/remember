<div id="y206">
  Divine Mother, be Thou the only flame shining on the altar of our hearts. Burn away any darkness that lurks there.<br>
  <br>
  Divine Mother, be Thou the only fragrance rising with the incense of our love for Thee. Permeate any dark nook in
  the hearts also of those we love.<br>
  <br>
  In our tears of love for Thee, wash away what attraction we feel for material objects. In our tears of communion with
  Thee, wash away all the sorrows of earth forevermore.<br>
  <br>
  Divine Mother, unite our separate hearts into one, great love, wherein Thy omnipresence can rest forever and forever.
  Teach us to behold our latent perfection in the clear mirror of Thy divinity. Let the altar-flame of our love for Thee
  rise in triumph, shaming the little, hissing sparks of all earthly desires.<br>
  <br>
  O Divine Mother, may our love be a shooting star racing gloriously through dark skies of forgetfulness, cutting its
  way through dark thunder-clouds of worldly preoccupation.<br>
  <br>
  Divine Mother, a million distractions have come to lure us away from thoughts of Thee. Thou Thyself, in order to test
  us, hast offered false, substitute fulfillments: pompous temple ceremonies to satisfy the ego needs of worldly
  people; religious organizations shouting, “Salvation can come only through serving this work!”; priests and
  ministers offering the Gospel, “God will bless you if you give us money!” O Mother, I have done with such outward
  shows in Thy name. I await Thee now in the inner temple of my love.<br>
  <br>
  Steal softly into this silent temple, Mother! With lambent flame banish the darkness of my long ignorance, and grant
  me safety in Thy ever-shining bliss.

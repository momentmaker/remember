  Thou light of my life—thou camest to spread wisdom’s glow over the path of my soul. Centuries of darkness dissolved
  before the shafts of thy luminous help. As a naughty baby I cried for my Mother Divine, and She came to me as my Guru,
  Swami Sri Yukteswar. At that meeting, O my Guru, a spark flew from thee, and the faggots of my God-craving, gathered
  through incarnations, smouldered and blazed into bliss. All my questions have been answered with thy flaming, golden
  touch. Eternal, ever-present satisfaction has come to me through thy glory.<br>
  <br>
  My Guru, thou voice of God, I found thee in response to my soul-cries. Slumbers of sorrow are gone, and I am awake in
  bliss.<br>
  If all the gods are displeased, yet thou art pleased, I am safe in the fortress of thy pleasure. And if all the gods
  protect me behind the parapets of their blessings, yet I receive not thy benedictions, I am an orphan left to pine
  spiritually in the ruins of thy displeasure. O Guru—thou didst bring me out of the bottomless pit of darkness into
  the paradise of peace.<br>
  <br>
  Our souls met after years of waiting. They trembled with an omnipresent thrill. We met here, because we had met
  before.<br>
  <br>
  Together we will fly to His shores, where we will smash our planes of finitude forever and vanish into infinite life.
  I bow to thee as the spoken voice of silent God. I bow to thee as the divine door which leads to the temple of
  salvation. I bow to thee—to thy Master, Lahiri Mahasaya, harbinger of Yoga in Benares; and I lay the flowers of my
  devotion at the feet of Babaji, our supreme Master!

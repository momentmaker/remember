  When the sparks of cosmic creation flew from under Thy crucible of love, I danced with all the lights that heralded
  the coming of a myriad worlds. I am a little spark of Thy joyous, cosmic fire. O Thou sun of life! as Thy nectar
  poured into the little cups of human minds filled with molten liquid of vital sparks, they thought to contain Thy
  golden infinity in the smallness of their human feelings.<br>
  <br>
  In each fragile, undulating mirror of human flesh I see reflected Thy restless dance of omnipresent power. In the
  lambent waters of life I behold Thy ever-steady, almighty life.<br>
  <br>
  Teach me, Christlike, by the power of concentration to still the restless storms of desire raging on the lake of my
  mind. Stilling those waters, I lovingly behold Thy unruffled face of cosmic stillness. Cause the little wave of my
  life to subside, that Thy consciousness in me spread out to become Thine own vastness.<br>
  <br>
  Let me feel my heart throbbing in Thy breast, my feet moving with Thy energy, Thy breath breathing through mine, Thy
  energy actively moving my arms, Thy thoughts weaving all the thoughts in my brain. When I cry, Thy soft sigh within me
  wakens me to Thy joy. In Thy playfulness, little bubble-visions of Thy Creation float dancingly in the chamber of my
  dreams, which manifest in my sleep of delusion.<br>
  <br>
  Thy meteoric will courses through the skies of my own will power. Make me feel that it is Thou who art I. Oh make me
  Thyself, that I behold my little bubble of self ever floating in Thee!

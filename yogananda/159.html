<div id="y159">
  I entered my temple of silence. Seated with a straight spine, I switched off the dazzling, diverting light of energy
  animating my sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. I commanded my breath to cease its cleansing work in the body
  and make no noise. I ordered my heart to suspend its dictatorship over my myriad body cells, forcing them to eat the
  blood it sends them. I sat still and listened.<br>
  <br>
  Then, Mother, I heard the soft approach of Thy footsteps. Thou didst come, bearing an overflowing chalice of
  life-sustaining, spiritual rays.<br>
  <br>
  Sustain me evermore, O Divine Mother, with Thy rays of lifegiving Light! The heart, cells, brains, and thoughts of
  this body— Thy body, not mine—will waste no longer with decay. Lo! they are now immortal with Thy everlasting life.

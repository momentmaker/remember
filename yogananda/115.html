<div id="y115">
  O Father, when I hover on the borderland between sleep and wakefulness, Thou dost come and play with me, Thy little
  child. I float on the ocean of Thy love. I dance with the boisterous billows of emotion. I play at hide and seek with
  Thee, as Thou dost with me. Thy greatness lifts me, this least of all Thy servitors, to sit with Thee on Thy throne.

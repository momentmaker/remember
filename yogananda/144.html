<div id="y144">
  Father, let me feel Thee through the touch of the breeze; through the sunshine warming my body. Enter through my
  nostrils with the fragrance of flowers. Let me cognize Thee through my innermost thoughts. Forget me never, even if I
  forget Thee. Remember me always, even if I remember Thee not. Be with me always, always, always!
</div>

  We were goldfish swimming happily in waters of peace, when the bait of name, fame, and superficial friendship lured
  us. Some of us nibbled at the bait; others fled at its sight. But alas, some swallowed the hook of worldly allure and
  deceptive sense-pleasure, and were pulled out onto the shores of satiety. There they fluttered with sadness, weakened
  by dry indifference, and expired finally, lacking the breath of Thy inner satisfaction.

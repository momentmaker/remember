<div id="y22">
  O Cosmic Vibration, reverberate through me as the Cosmic, Intelligent Sound. Teach me to find in Thee the presence of
  the reflected Christ consciousness. O Holy Vibration, lead me to intuit that Christ in Thee.<br>
  <br>
  O omnipresent, cosmic sound of Aum (or Amen), reverberate through me, and expand my consciousness from this body to
  whole universe. Teach me to feel in Thee the all-permeating, perennial Bliss of the Supreme Spirit.

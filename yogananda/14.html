<div id="q14">
  Do not be anxious if you don’t have meditative experiences.<br>
  The path to God is not a circus!<br>
  Don’t even be anxious about such fruits of meditation as inner joy and peace.<br>
  Everything will come in time.<br>
  Meanwhile, consider meditation, too,<br>
  as a form of karma yoga:<br>
  action without desire for the fruits of action.<br>
  Meditate above all to please your higher self,<br>
  not your ego.

<div id="y102">
  I am here before Thee, Father, hurling again and again the spears of prayer to pierce the bulwarks of Thy dark
  silence. Missile after missile of yearning for Thee must surely break down, in time, the ramparts of my ignorance and
  delusion! With firm faith I invoke Thee! Shine before my gaze the searchlight of true wisdom, that I find some chink
  in those high walls of my ignorance, that I may rescue Thee from the dungeon to which my lower self so long ago
  consigned Thee.

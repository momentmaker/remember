<div id="y192">
  Teach me to feel that, but for the right use of Thy grace and wisdom, I too might have been lame, leprous, or blind;
  and, were I lame or blind even by my own wrong actions, I would certainly crave to be healed.<br>
  <br>
  So do Thou, whenever I see anyone crippled or shattered by sorrow: Make me feel that it is Thou who art suffering in
  those forms. Teach me to instill in them, furthermore, the health and peace I myself have attained.<br>
  <br>
  Teach me to sympathize with the cries, needs, and sufferings of others, that I may be as eager to free them from those
  burdens as I would be to free myself.<br>
  <br>
  Sorrowing, struggling, weeping, and smiling in empathy with the needs of all, may I at last find my soulâ€™s real
  identity with all.

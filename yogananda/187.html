<div id="y187">
  Many doors opened before me at the dawn of Thy coming. O Lord, the very earth shone with life when Thou camest. The
  very ground on which I stood thrilled me because of Thee. Everywhere dumb matter spoke to me, spirit-resurrected by
  Thy touch. All living things swayed in the incense-breeze of Thy approach, hinting at Thy perfume of bliss.<br>
  <br>
  Thy sanctuary of omnipresence was long hidden by the darkness of my indifference. Now, on the revealed courtyard of
  Thy temple, I find Thy fountain of joy, gaily bubbling. With uplifted palm-cups of craving, I catch and drink from the
  vital waters of Thy solace. Lord, I know now that I shall thirst nevermore.

<div id="y179">
  The sunbeams of Thy love shine equally on all the members of Thy cosmic family, whether prophet, hero, villain, tiny
  moth, or me. It is our own fault if we make ourselves opaque by our own mental and emotional dullness. Teach us to
  wipe away the dirt of error from the windows of our understanding.<br>
  <br>
  Our arms are weak for the task, owing to our long inner spiritual resistance. O Master Cleanser, lend power to our
  efforts, that we may wipe away every last spot that clings to our minds, obscuring our transparency and preventing
  free entry to Thy light. Oh, make us fully clean again, invisible in our egos because transmitting only visions of
  Thy beauty, which lies within us.

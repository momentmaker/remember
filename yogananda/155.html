  Bless me, Father, that I behold the Eastern star of wisdom. May it shine before my human eyes as much in daylight as
  in darkness. Long my eyes were blinded by the tinsel-glitter of materiality. Seeing things always outwardly, I saw
  not the Spirit behind and within them. I saw the mustard-seed of matter, but spied not the oil of Spirit that it
  contained. My third eye of wisdom is now opened. Oh, may it always be so! Let the gaze of my single eye of realization
  penetrate through every veil of matter to behold the infinite presence of Christ, everywhere. Bless me, that my
  sacred, wise thoughts, following this star of knowledge, lead me to the Christ in everything.

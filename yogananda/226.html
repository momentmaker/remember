<div id="y226">
  O Mother Divine, teach me to love others, and to serve them in Thy name. Teach me to be true to my word, even as I
  want others to be true to theirs. Teach me to love others, even as I want them to love me. Teach me, O Dearest
  Heavenly Mother, to make others happy, and to make them smile. Teach me to find my happiness in the happiness of
  all.

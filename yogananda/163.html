<div id="y163">
  I am the foam of happiness spumed out of the sea of Thy joy! I am the ocean life bounding with the billows of joy!
  Endless eddies of my laughter spread through all hearts. When the time comes to depart, I will retire to wakeful sleep
  on the bosom of Thy infinite joy, a ripple ever dancing with billows of all joy. I am a bubble of joy, struggling to
  burst and unite with the ocean of joy.<br>
  <br>
  I feel Thy joy in all things! Make me a lighthouse of joy also, guiding storm-tossed vessels of life to safety on the
  shores of Thy joy.<br>
  <br>
  Let every vine of my activity bear large grape clusters of Thy joy! Let me drink the divine wine pressed from the
  grapes of all lifeâ€™s little joys!

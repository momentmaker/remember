<div id="y194">
  I may go far, farther than the farthest star, but I will be Thine always! Devotees may come, devotees may go, but I
  will be Thine always.<br>
  <br>
  I may bound over billows of many lives under sad, dark skies of loneliness, but I will be Thine always.<br>
  <br>
  The whole world may ignore Thee, engrossed as it is in Thy gifts of money, power, and pleasure—mere playthings!—but I
  will be Thine always. Take everything from me if Thou willst, but, Lord, I will be Thine always.<br>
  <br>
  Death, disease, and every imaginable trial may riddle and rend me, yet, while the embers of memory still flicker, look
  into my dying eyes: They will mutely say, “I will be Thine always.”<br>
  <br>
  My voice may grow feeble, fail, and forsake me, and yet, with bursting heart and with the silent voice of my soul, I
  will ever whisper to Thee, “My Lord, I am Thine always!”

<div id="y169">
  I care not if, in the destruction of my desires, I must shatter my very self—jostling through sextillions of lives,
  and undergoing again and again the throes of birth and the pangs of death! I can endure all suffering so long as, at
  the end of it, I attain my supreme goal: oneness with Thy bliss. What care I if I leave behind mangled heaps of my
  fleshly forms, broken by my struggles to reach Thee?<br>
  <br>
  I offer all my earthly happiness in exchange for Thy joy. I renounce all elusive joys for eternal freedom in Thy
  joy. Thy bliss alone is mine, alone is mine.<br>
  <br>
  Oh! Tell me clearly that Thou wilt surely be mine! I can wait patiently, then, a hundred thousand years as if they
  were but a day.<br>
  <br>
  Tell me—wilt Thou be mine?

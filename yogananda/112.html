<div id="y112">
  O Father, behold me through the pores of the sky. Smile at me through the twinkling stars. Strengthen me through the
  sun; calm my feelings through the moon. Caress me through the breeze. Love me through my love. Throb in me through my
  heart. Breathe Thine immortality through this mortal frame of mine. Speak through my voice. Help others through my
  hands. Use my mind to inspire them. Breathe through my breath. For within this fragile viol Thou alone canst sing Thy
  complete, eternal song.

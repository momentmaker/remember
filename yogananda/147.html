<div id="y147">
  I want to use my own will, but guide it ever, Father, toward the golden paradise of all fulfillment. For I would be
  infinity’s smiling child, confident of being imprisoned no longer behind bars of fruitless desire and withered
  hopes.<br>
  <br>
  I would break the shameful cords of lethargy that have presumed to hold me, and step fearlessly into freedom.
  Released, I now blaze my way through forests of every limitation and delusion.<br>
  <br>
  Oh, my little, vain ego may strut proudly, saying: “Behold my glory! Worship me!” But I will look through its
  transparent form and behold Thine unimaginable beauty clothed in the subtle form of the whole universe! The
  silence-tuned hearing of my soul will ignore that tiny, boasting masquerader, my little self impersonating Thee, and
  will listen rapturously to the wind-borne, fragrant music of Thine own matchless voice whispering across the ages: “I
  am He!”

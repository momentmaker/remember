  Dear Heavenly Father, when I slake my thirst with cool water, it is Thy nourishment which refreshes me. When I wash
  myself, I make myself clean for Thee, even as Thou dost want my heartâ€™s feelings always to be pure. When I feel the
  sunshine on my face and skin, I feel Thy love in that warm touch. I bow to Thee in the sunshine, in the breezes, in
  the dawn, the noon, the evening light. And I bow to Thee in the forms of all those who love me.

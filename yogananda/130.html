<div id="y130">
  With the love of all human loves I have come to love Thee, Thou God of all loves. Thou art the father, anxious to
  protect His children. Thou art the little child, lisping love to its parents. Thou art the mother, showering infinite
  kindnesses on all her family. Thou dost flow in the all-surrendering love of the lover for the beloved. Thou art the
  love of friends for one another. Purify me with the reverence of a servant to his master. Teach me to love Thee with
  all pure loves, for Thou art the fountain of love both earthly and heavenly. Bathe me in the fountain-spray of all
  loves.

<div id="y165">
  The fire of ambition has been waxing strong, fed by the fuel of my evanescent, rainbow-dreams. As often as one dream
  faded away, a new one, as persistent as the last, burst open, flower-like, in my heart, only to wither and die. The
  lightning of disaster struck, consuming not once but many times my garden of hopes, as flames destroyed even my very
  powers of renewal.<br>
  <br>
  My garden was once green with life, but as the gray ghosts of half-dead hopes and low vitality glided in, surrounded
  by dark doubts, I began to fear. Would they frighten me as, with timid footsteps, I turned at last toward Thee?<br>
  <br>
  Come to my aid, O Divine Friend! Give me the strength now to be ambitious only in my quest for Thee.

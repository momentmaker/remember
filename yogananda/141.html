<div id="y141">
  In the hall of life, decorated with mountains, stormy cataracts, and wild scenery, I have played long. Each time,
  when, tired of play, I cried for Thee, Thou didst drop down through the skylight of my heartâ€™s craving some new doll
  of fame, friends, or prosperity to quiet me. This time, Divine Mother, I will play the naughty baby. I will sob
  unceasingly. No more shall the toys of earthly pleasure stop my cries. O Divine Mother, Thou must come soon, or I
  will waken all Creation with my cries! I will make all Thy sleeping children wake and join me in a chorus of wails.
  Forsake Thy busyness with the housework of Thy Creation! I demand attention. I demand Thee! I no longer want Thy
  playthings!

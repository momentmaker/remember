<div id="y107">
  Veils surround me, Father, hiding Thee from me. I love the dainty, colored veils of roses and daisies; the shining
  veils of clouds of burning gold; the dark, star-decked shawl of the night. But— how long wilt Thou remain hidden
  behind all these veils? I love them because they hint at Thy presence. Yet still they hide Thee! I long to see Thee as
  Thou art—behind all this cover of veils!

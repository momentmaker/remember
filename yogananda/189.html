  Can the blind man appreciate the light? Can the deaf man appreciate song?<br>
  <br>
  O Father, how can a person intoxicated with the pleasures of the senses appreciate clearly the benefits of good health
  and the physical energy and mental clarity that come with self-control?<br>
  <br>
  Father, how can the luxury-satiated and sense-surfeited hear the celestial, peace-giving chorus of noble qualities in
  simple, humble, but spiritually rich souls?<br>
  <br>
  Bless us, that we may behold in the subtle, beautiful rays of good habits this truth: that virtue is far more
  attractive, invigorating, and satisfying than vice, and that it opens the way for us to hear Thy guiding voice
  behind all other sounds.

<div id="y2">
  Thou art our Father. We are made in Thine image. We are Thy children. We neither ask nor pray as beggars, but demand
  of Thee, as Thy children, the gifts of wisdom, salvation, health, happiness, and eternal joy. Whether naughty or good,
  we are still Thy children, all of us. Help us to perceive and understand, inwardly, Thy will for us. Teach us the
  independent use of our human will (since Thou gavest it to us to use freely), attuned to Thy wisdom-guided will.

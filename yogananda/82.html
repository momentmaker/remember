  Teach me, O Spirit, to love Thee as whole-heartedly as the miser loves money. Make me as attached to Thee as the
  drunkard is addicted to wine. Teach me to cling to Thee as erring ones do to their bad habits. Teach me to be as
  attentive to Thee as a mother is to her child. Teach me to perform my duties diligently, with my attention fully
  riveted on Thee. Teach me to love Thee as the worldly man loves his possessions. With the first love of true lovers,
  teach me to love Thee.

<div id="y53">
  I was shipwrecked on the storm-tossed ocean of mere dreams. My vessel of happiness was shattered utterly. Struggling,
  I tried to swim through those tossing waves of sadness and suffering. Then, suddenly, a little raft of hope, wafted to
  me by Thy winds of mercy, came floating to me! I grasped itâ€”and held on! Little by little, floating thereon, I
  touched at last upon the golden isle of peaceful silence. Nymphs of Thy blessings met me and took me to Thy safe
  presence of eternal reassurance, beyond all waves of false, rising hopes and crashing disappointments.

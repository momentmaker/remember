  My allotted plot of consciousness was small. Carelessly I let it grow barren; it produced no crops of inner,
  life-sustaining culture. Now the bleak winter of dead opportunities approaches with its pall of unproductivity.<br>
  <br>
  My lot is small, and my lifeâ€™s season is short, yet now I would produce a mighty harvest. I will expand my kingdom of
  will power. To do so, I must conquer new states of consciousness, enlarge my achievements, and outgrow, in
  consciousness, every limiting horizon.<br>
  <br>
  But, O Father Divine, there are billions of my hungry thought-families and their little ones to feed! And, for them,
  I need a big harvest during this short season of my earth-life.<br>
  <br>
  The irrigating waters of my craving many times grew dry, while my soil of inner culture was left undeveloped. Now I
  will work all the harder, using the machinery of scientific technique in my search for Thee.<br>
  <br>
  O Divine Sower, with Thine unseen hand throw Thy living seeds of inspiration into the cultivated furrows of my
  awakened resolution.<br>
  <br>
  In this short, remaining season of my earthly life let me reap the largest harvest of all: Thy cosmic vision!

  I attuned my life with Thine. Now my life has become a long, unbroken inspiration. Thy fountain of bliss refreshes and
  delights me night and day, whether I be wakeful, fast asleep, or dreaming fondly of Thee. Oh, what has become of me?
  Delight on overwhelming delight! Endless, indescribable thrills of divine delight spray unceasingly over me!<br>
  <br>
  O aged nectar! Wine of centuries! I found Thee at last, and will taste of Thy sweetness forever, forever, forever!

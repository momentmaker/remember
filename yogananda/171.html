  The doomsday clouds of inevitably tragic events thundered and poured down sheets of suffering on my life. My courage
  almost drowned in fear, as a million difficulties rose up to destroy me. Only by clinging fast to Thee did I
  survive.<br>
  <br>
  Now, when the cannons of uncertainty boom before me and the shells of calumny, persecution, and fierce opposition fall
  rain-like around me, I am ever protected in the impregnable fortress of Thy love. I am so grateful to Thee!<br>
  <br>
  When the light of good fortune dawns again, as it must always, following every hard night of struggles, it is easy to
  smile welcomingly at the pleasing sunrise of Thy grace. During dark nights of misfortune, however, I find it even
  sweeter, now, to offer Thee the flowers of my appreciation for being always there, protecting me. I offer all my
  gratitude at Thy feet of deep, inner communion. Receive me, my Eternal Beloved, in sacred silence.

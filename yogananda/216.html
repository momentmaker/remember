  The opened door of meditation released the caged bird of omnipresence. It fluttered, then spread its wings, and flew
  up and outward over infinite spaces. Its joyful song brought peace to every unhappiness-scorched being.<br>
  <br>
  Alas, unaccustomed to its newly found freedom, the soaring bird remembered the little cage that had enclosed it in old
  ways. It flew back, hopped inside, and folded its wings, hiding again— “safely,” as it thought!—with its illusory
  security.<br>
  <br>
  O bird of eternity, take heart! Break out forever from that little prison of imaginary security, and soar up to thy
  barless home in everything!

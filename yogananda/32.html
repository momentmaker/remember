<div id="y32">
  Let me be Christian, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, Mohammedan, or Sufi: I care not what be my religion, race, creed, or color,
  if only I can win my way to Thee! But let me be none of these if that identity enmeshes me in an enclosing net of
  religious or social formalities. Let me travel the royal high road of realization which leads to Thee. If I am
  traveling on some bypath of religion, lead me onto the one common highway of realization which leads straight to
  Thee.<br>
  <br>
  Send me the sunshine of Thy wisdom, that it lead me to the morning of my growing powers; and send me the moon of Thy
  mercy to guide me rightly, if ever I am lost in the dark night of sorrow.

  Beholding the ever-changing sound-and-motion-pictures of life, I am aware that this turbulent dancing show is only a
  vast illusion.<br>
  <br>
  The tragedies, comedies, and paradoxes of life; the dreams of birth and death; the changing scenes and places that
  surge round us: all these are nothing but movies, designed to engage us in the Cosmic Illusion.<br>
  <br>
  O Divine Operator, with Thy cosmic vibratory light Thou dost show us ever-new thrills: a motion picture true to all
  our five senses, keeping us amused and entertained through sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. O Magic Operator,
  Thy true-seeming spectacle beams daily onto the screens of our consciousness.<br>
  <br>
  I take it as Thy grace that I’ve been chosen to play both tragic and comic parts in Thy drama. I am happy to have
  acted all those parts, both of sorrow and of joy. Still, Father, give me now and then a few days of respite from my
  task! Let me retire to my closet of introspection, stand before my own thought-audiences, and behold with laughing
  heart all the tragedies and comedies I have enacted.<br>
  <br>
  Teach me to look upon all that happens in my life with a pleased, interested attitude, that at the end of each
  episode, no matter how sad or difficult, I may exclaim: “Ah, that was a good show, full of thrills, suspense, and
  excitement! I am happy to have seen it, and I have learned much from it for my own benefit.”

  O Mohammed, thou flaming Child of God! in the bright luster of thy martial, celestial song many found courage for
  their chivalrous souls, eager as they were to rescue the damsel, knowledge, from the tyrant of soul-darkness.<br>
  <br>
  None but divine warriors could ever win the battle between inner peace and the outer weaknesses of lustful pleasure.
  Therefore alone have thy soldiers dipped rapiers of shining goodness into the heart of poisonous evil, enlightening
  its inner, soul life.<br>
  <br>
  Mohammed, iconoclast of all matter-reminding idols, thou didst teach the worship of the One Formless God, beyond all
  distorting dreams of symbols and forms.<br>
  <br>
  Mohammed, thy teachings warned men not to stray into dry pastures of earthly sense-lusts, but to graze in rich fields
  of the immortal mind.<br>
  <br>
  Thy followers are drawn to thee as the mortal enemy of sense-drugging, thought-devastating, God-banishing liquors and
  opiates. Thou didst teach that the lust for wine of the grape is man’s misguided craving for the real Wine extracted
  from the winepress of sincere, regular Namaz, bowing before God.<br>
  <br>
  Mohammed, thy lighthouse, the Koran, has guided many stray soul-ships safely past underwater rocks of sin, and led
  them, undamaged, to His shore.<br>
  <br>
  Thou didst teach by thy example, through occasional fasting and through eliminating the grosser foods, inviting the
  Spirit to descend onto the altar of refinement and soul-nectar.<br>
  <br>
  Mohammed, with the beat of war-drums saying Allah Ho Ak‐ bar, “God is Supreme,” help me to drive away from my life the
  Satan of matter-immersion.<br>
  <br>
  May thy war-songs of spiritual power overcome the forces of frailty and all limitation when they invade our hearts.

<div id="y120">
  The orphans and the stricken have heard of Thy healing power. They have come to Thy door. Wilt Thou turn them away
  empty-handed? Those whose hearts are breaking with sadness and despair: dry their scalding teardrops with Thy
  invisible hand. Those who are lost in delusionâ€”to whom shall they turn, but to Thee? Lift Thine unseen veil of silence
  and appear in Thy overwhelming, divine compassion. Before the coming of the dawn of Thy presence, all their dark
  troubles will take wing.

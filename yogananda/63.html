  O Infinite Alchemist, spiritualize our weaknesses into strength, and our wrong thoughts into right thoughts. Grow Thou
  a flower of divine understanding from every seed of activity. With the magic wand of foresight, given by Thee, teach
  us to transmute the ugly imps of selfish ambition into fairies of all-serving, noble aspirations. Train, Lord, each
  stallion of desire to become a champion racing for Thine abode. Transform our base ignorance into the gold of wisdom,
  that it become a liquid stream of spiritual gold, rushing steadily to Thy shore.

<div id="y42">
  Impediments, beware! Flee my path! I am homeward bound. Through the long corridors of time, stumbling often into pits
  of error, then lifted out by Thy unseen hand, I have walked painfully. Discouraging darkness, barbed-wire fences of
  habit, stoney embankments of indolence, mountains of indifference, oceans of unfaithfulness, sirens of sense-longing
  may stand even now in my path, as if to prevent my onward march to Thy palace; but a million kingdoms and
  sextillions of years of unblemished worldly happiness will never tempt me again to turn away from Thee.

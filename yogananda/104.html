<div id="y104">
  The breeze of Thy love wafts through me, O Father. Leaves on my tree of life tremble gently in response to Thy coming.
  My soul-blossoms have begun to awaken. The rustling murmur of my thought-leaves, whispering in the ether, calls to all
  matter-weary beings to come rest in the shade of my peace, received from Thee.

<div id="y67">
  The caravan of my prayers is moving toward Thee. In the eyes of kindness I behold glimmers of Thy mercy. Even the bare
  trees of dark lives flicker with a myriad glow-worms of Thy shining life. The caravan of my prayers has been working
  its way slowly through dry wastes of arid doubts and furious sand-storms of despondency. Yet, at last, far-off
  glimpses of Thy oasis of silent assurance have roused me in my drooping efforts. Eagerly I await the moment when I
  can dip into Thy revivifying water my parched, thirsty lips of faith, and there drink deeply from Thy well of bliss.

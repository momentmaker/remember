<div id="y222">
  When I dance happily, dear Heavenly Father, I dance with Thee. Wherever I look, I see Thee peeping out at me from just
  behind everything. I see Thee every day, painting the sky with bright colors. I watch Thee clothing the bare ground
  with green grass. I see Thee shining in the sunshine. Oh, I see Thee so plainly present everywhere! I bow to Thee!

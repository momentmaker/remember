<div id="y215">
  A million salutations at Thy petaled feet, O Lotus of Light! I pour out my heartâ€™s love before Thee. I pour out my
  whole being. I offer all the fragrant musk of my soul at Thy feet of omnipresence.<br>
  <br>
  O precious, Blessed One, pipe the song of Thy bliss in the dark bower of my heart. I am Thy very own! Ever shall I be
  Thy own! I will laugh at all dangers, for Thy protecting love fills the golden chalice of my constant remembrance of
  Thee.<br>
  <br>
  I cast every earthly passion and pleasure into Thy sacrificial fire as an oblation of my devotion to Thee. In Thy
  blessed light I will illuminate all shadows, and expose as illusory my imaginary fears. In Thy radiant light I will
  remain awake forever, entranced by Thy thrilling, omnipresent bliss-smile through all eternity.<br>
  <br>
  May Thy love shine forever on the sanctuary of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts.
  Oh, make my soul Thy temple! Make my heart Thine altar! And make my love Thy home!

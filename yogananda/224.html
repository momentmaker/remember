  Dear Heavenly Father, the moonlight reminds me that all darkness passes. The sun reminds me that my mind, too,
  should be bathed in light. The seasons change because that is how I can have food to eat. The seasons change, also, to
  teach me to adjust to all lifeâ€™s changes. Thou art behind everything, teaching deep secrets for living a better life.
  Always I bow to Thee.

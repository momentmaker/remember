<div id="y127">
  Mother Divine, the brave may laugh as they pass among flying bullets though death threatens with each one. I laugh,
  however, because whether I am floating on the surface of this present life or sinking beneath the waves of death, I
  rest forever in Thy protecting, omnipresent, eternal life, held safely forever in Thy immortal arms.

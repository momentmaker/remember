<div id="y158">
  Father, swimming in the sea of my craving for Thee, I find myself beaten by the winds of severe trials. Floating on
  cresting waves of pleasure and pain, then sinking down into the depths of indifference, I still keep looking for Thy
  shoreless shore. With every stroke of my powerful prayer I move nearer to Thee. Never shall I give up! Thou Thyself, I
  know, dost look for my coming.

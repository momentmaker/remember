  Volumes of Thy savior voice resound through the loudspeaker of every loving heart. The voice of Thy wisdom roams
  through the ether of space, seeking everywhere hearts that are tuned to ecstasy.<br>
  <br>
  Sadly, Thy warning sermons pass unheard by souls deafened with the static of sense pleasures.<br>
  <br>
  O Divine Broadcaster, tune our souls, long distracted by the static of our indifference. “Fine tune” us with the
  delicate touch of soul-perception. Grant us the privilege of hearing Thy magic melodies in the ecstasy of divine
  awakening!

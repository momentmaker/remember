<div id="q18">
  Many people meditate till they feel a touch of peace,<br>
  but jump up then and leave their meditation for their activities.<br>
  Thatâ€™s all right,<br>
  if you have important work waiting for you,<br>
  for it is always better to meditate before any activity,<br>
  that you may feel at least some peace as you work.<br>
  Whenever possible, however,<br>
  sit for a long time after your practice of techniques.<br>
  That is when the deepest enjoyment comes.<br>
  Intuition is developed by continuously deepening that enjoyment,<br>
  and, later on,<br>
  by holding on to its calm aftereffect.

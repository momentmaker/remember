<div id="y18">
  Divine Father, teach me to dive deep for the pearls of Thy wisdom in the ocean of meditation. Teach me to plunge
  headlong, protected in the diving suit of conscience, that the sharks of passion may not destroy me. If, by one or
  two divings, I find not Thy wisdom-pearls, let me not call the sea of meditation devoid of any pearl of Thy wisdom.
  Teach me, rather, to find fault with my own diving. Teach me to dive again and again in meditation, deeper and deeper
  always, until I find Thine immortal pearls of wisdom and of joy divine.

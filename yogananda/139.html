<div id="y139">
  Thy gentle voice saying, “Come home!” I often heard. But through many lives it was drowned in the tumult of my wild
  cravings. I have forsaken the jostling crowds of desire. In the solitude of my mind my devotion bursts to hear Thy
  voice. Take away every dream-memory of earthly sounds that yet lurks in my mind. I want to hear Thy still voice, ever
  singing in the silence of my soul.

<div id="y161">
  Infinite Spirit, teach me to comprehend the utter uselessness of being afraid. Help me to keep in mind that even
  death, since come it must, at least comes only once and need not be suffered a thousand times, beforehand, through
  fear! When death does come it will be by Nature’s mercy. When it comes, I will welcome it in my soul, for I will
  understand that it is time for me to move on, lowering the curtain on this life’s drama, but traveling, perhaps, to
  something new and equally interesting. Let me not be a “psychological antique,” fearing change.<br>
  <br>
  Teach me not to paralyze my nerves daily with the dread of some future, imaginary accident. Such dread may only invite
  the accident to happen!<br>
  <br>
  Bless me, that I not let fear anaesthetize my mind and shut off my unlimited power, as Thy child, to overcome all
  tests and trials. Help me to realize that, whether I am awake or asleep, alert or dreaming, Thine all-protecting
  presence encircles me always.<br>
  <br>
  Help me to see that neither mighty fortress nor the wealth of Croesus could protect me from disease, earthquakes, and
  all kinds of accidents, that Thou alone art my protector, and that, though I walk where bullets fly or where swarms of
  bacteria abound, I am ever safe, enhaloed in Thy all-sheltering light.

<div id="y71">
  O Fountain of love, flood the lowlands of our love for home and family with Thy omnipresent love. O Mighty Source of
  all our rivers of desire, teach us not to cut ourselves off from Thee, hunting on dry sands of
  sense-satisfaction.<br>
  <br>
  Love is our soulsâ€™ birthright! We demand, now, that all the rivers of our cravings be redirected through valleys of
  humility, eager self-sacrifice, and concern for others until, reinforced by Thy torrential blessings, they merge in
  the ocean of all fulfillment in Thee.<br>
  <br>
  Bless us, that the rivulets of our sympathy, affection, and love lose not themselves in the sands of dreary
  selfishness.<br>
  <br>
  Let the little, lonely, separately-moving streamlets of our love, which come from Thee, merge at last in the vastness
  of Thy perfect Love.

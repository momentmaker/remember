<div id="y47">
  Rocked in the cradle of the blue-colored past, bright-colored present, and dim, grey-colored future I, Thy child of
  eternity, am restless.<br>
  <br>
  I strained ineffectually the feet of my power. At last I succeeded in jumping out from dualityâ€™s cradle of delusion.
  Thou hast caught me in Thy infinite arms to rock me in all space.<br>
  <br>
  I am Thy babe of eternity, safe now in the cradle of Thy omnipresent bosom.

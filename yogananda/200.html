  Long ago I had a little torch; it was a plaything of my mind. I toyed with it. Atiptoe I would work it, peering into
  dark, secret corners of my thoughts. In its gleam I would capture glimpses, in dark mental waters, of many little
  golden minnows of creative ideas.<br>
  <br>
  I caught some of them, and used them for bait to catch bigger denizens of my consciousness. But my hook was small, and
  many large fish of inspiration got away.<br>
  <br>
  Now I carry a searchlight, and no hook and line, but a net purchased with the precious, gold-spun dreams of
  increasing understanding. With my large net of woven light, I will sweep the very ocean floor for Thy wisdom. Ah! My
  expanding net will encompass all Thy ocean! I will haul to myself all the goodness, golden deeds, and drops of
  inspiration—yes, too, Thy very Self!—and make all that my own.

  Thy astral airplane of parting came to take my soul away from this earth. I wondered through what strange skies I
  would soar now, and to what lands I would travel.<br>
  <br>
  I asked the mystic Pilot, Cosmic Law, whither I was to go. That Silent One answered soundlessly:<br>
  <br>
  “I am the Pilot of Life, mistakenly called Terrible Death by ignorant earth-folk. I am thy brother, uplifter,
  redeemer, friend— unloader of every gross burden of bodily troubles. I have come to fetch thee away from thy valley of
  broken dreams to the highlands of light, where poisonous vapors of sorrow never rise.<br>
  <br>
  “I have broken mercifully thy cage of flesh-attachment that thy soul-bird may escape. I have broken thy chains of
  disease and fear. Thy long encasement behind bars of bones accustomed thee to thy little cage, making thee cling to it
  fearfully even when I opened its door. Yet, in thy heart, thou didst want thy freedom always. Why, now, art thou
  fear-filled, having won thy long-craved freedom?<br>
  <br>
  “O bird of paradise! hop into My plane of omnipresence! Fold now thy fluttering wings and ride with Me peacefully,
  anywhere, everywhere in thine ethereal home!”

  O Thou Thief of Hearts, the rays of joy spreading in the firmament of my inner silence heralded the promise of Thine
  approach.<br>
  <br>
  Many nights in twinkling garments, many dawns donning green veils of glittering, dewy pearls, many twilights
  dancing in cadence with cow-bells, many years decked with spring-blossoms, summer-zephyrs, diamond-icicles, and
  shining garments of fluttering rain that blushed with joyous expectancy: all waited for Thee in the
  bower of memory.<br>
  <br>
  But the wolf of time stole upon Thy devotees; now they are no more, and I am left alone—all alone—and love for fickle
  festivities has flown. Yet will I travel with the ever-roaming hours in search of Thy path. I mind not if I must wait
  even a thousand millennia, for I know I shall catch Thee, O Thief of Hearts, sometime, at eternity’s end!

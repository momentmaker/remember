<div id="y55">
  The gulf of ages lay between Thee and me, widening as the waters of my oblivion of Thee grew through centuries.<br>
  <br>
  I stand on this rocky shore of matter, gazing out over the gulf, hoping to see, beyond, Thy smooth shores of peace. My
  inner thought-architects will build for me a bridge of constant remembrance of Thee. The strong, mental girders of
  self-control, now, are being riveted together.<br>
  <br>
  My dreams of Thee gather to make a rainbow-bridge of Self-realization over which, very soon, I will reach Thy shore.

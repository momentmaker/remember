<div id="y167">
  O Spirit, as no work is possible without borrowing, from Thee, the power to perform it, so, teach us to consider no
  work greater than Thy spiritual work.<br>
  <br>
  Teach us to feel that, since no duty is possible without Thee, so, no duty is more important than our duty to Thee.
  And teach us to love Thee above everything, for we cannot live or love anything or anybody without Thy Life, Thy love.

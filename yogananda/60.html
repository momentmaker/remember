  With the soft finger-touches of my soul-intuition, I tuned the radio of my inner perception. At first I caught only
  the sounds of nearby experience. Then came a symphony of inner harmony, followed by sweet strains from my heartâ€™s
  orchestra of finer feelings. And then came the swelling chorus of my age-long cravings for Thee. All these I caught
  on the radio of my soul as I kept tuning my perception, waiting to catch the whispers of Thy voice, O Guardian Angel
  of all souls!<br>
  <br>
  With infinite patience I went on tuning my radio. At last, when I was almost prepared to give up further trying, Thy
  song burst upon my heart. Oh! let me broadcast through my every word, now, the chorus of Thy songs.

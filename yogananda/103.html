<div id="y103">
  My eyes are enthralled, O Father, with the beauty of earthly flowers, with lifeâ€™s passing scenes, and with the
  sailing, silent clouds. Everywhere, all I see hints at Thy hidden presence. Open that eye in me which sees only Thee.
  With that gaze may I behold Thee above, beneath, all around, within, and outside me. Teach me in all things to see
  only Thee. Open in me that eye which beholds everywhere Thy hidden but ever subtly reigning wonder.<br>
  <br>
  (This demand, especially, should be repeated mentally with deep concentration until the prayer-thought becomes fixed
  in your superconscious by the conviction born of deep faith.)

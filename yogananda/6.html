<div id="y6">
  With a myriad of living thoughts of devotion, I have built for Thee a temple of awakened silence. I have brought the
  multi-colored lamps of wisdom from all valid faiths. They shine with the luster of Thy one truth.<br>
  <br>
  The commingled incense of human craving for Thy love soars up in spirals from the incense-bowl of our hearts. Thy
  sacred presence shines on altars everywhere.<br>
  <br>
  All prayers of all temples, tabernacles, churches, mosques, and viharas are chanting to Thee in the universal language
  of deep love. The orchestra of our combined feelings plays in harmony with the chorus of all soul-songs, with the cry
  of all tears, with the bursting shout of all joys, and with the united anthem of all prayers.<br>
  <br>
  In this wall-less cosmic temple of the soul, we worship Thee our one Father. Be pleased to reveal Thyself to us
  always. Amen, Aum, Amin.

<div id="y125">
  Bless me, my own true Father, that I may fly with Thee from peak to peak, or lie on the grass and sing Thy song to the
  birds. Bless me, that I may wade through the streams of human feeling to bring to all the song of Thy glory. Bless me
  that I may whirl around starry rims, blazing Thy name. With the nebulae I will spread Thy holy name. Bless me, that
  with the humming atoms I may attune my song to Thine.

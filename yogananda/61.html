<div id="y61">
  In the summer days of life, teach me to gather honey from the flowers of all spiritual qualities that blossom in the
  garden of truthful souls.<br>
  <br>
  I will store the perfume of forgiveness in the honeycomb of my heart: the lotus fragrance of humility; myrrh-scented
  devotion; the rare honey of all soul-qualities. And even though the snowflakes of wintry experiences and earthly
  separations whirl about me, I shall seek Thee in the honeycomb of my heart where often I have found Thee, stealing the
  stored honey of my devotion.<br>
  <br>
  Wherever Thou hast come—in every place hallowed by Thy feet—I will lie, touching Thy footprints. Ah! there alone will
  I find a place of true safety.

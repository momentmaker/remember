  I sought to catch Thee in the deep waters of superconsciousness. Little fishes of inspiration nibbled at my bait of
  meditation.<br>
  <br>
  My concentration bobbed, but every time I pulled I missed Thee.<br>
  <br>
  I baited the hook of my meditation with the tasty spice of love: the little fishes tugged, and I watched them do so
  with attentive zeal. Lo! my mindâ€™s float vanished beneath Thy waves of bliss.<br>
  <br>
  O Colossal Denizen of my consciousness! I pulled at Thee, and with a bound Thou didst leap to the shores of my heart.
  Teach me to fish for Thee ever in the deepest waters of my soul.

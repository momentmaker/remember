  I disconnected my awareness from the little garden plot of the senses and switched it to the vast territory of the
  Infinite. The aurora of my awareness spread like dancing waves of light in the aurora borealis, and embraced Thy
  cosmic wonderland.<br>
  <br>
  When thus I entered that vast panorama, my awareness no longer dulled by the opiate of sensory noises nor blindfolded
  by the veil of mere appearances, I stood marveling before countless streams of radiant, rushing thoughts, rippling
  through millennia from long-dead, still-living, and yet-to-be-born civilizations.<br>
  <br>
  All time—past, present, future—danced its infinitude of rhythms on the stage of my all-embracing consciousness.

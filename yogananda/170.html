<div id="y170">
  I come to Thee with the song of my smiles. Whatever treasures have lain in the secrecy of my soul, I bring eagerly to
  Thee. I bring Thee all the honey from the hive of my heart. All that was ever mine is now Thine alone.<br>
  <br>
  The sunlight of this world, shining upon my eager hopes and brief, fickle fulfillments, burned me repeatedly with
  dissatisfaction. Now I will quench my thirst forever in Thy radiant waters!<br>
  <br>
  The taper of my aspiration toward happiness will burst aflame with Thy coming into a conflagration of bliss.<br>
  <br>
  In Thy vast, enchanting sea of light I will swim joyfully forever. Teach me to drown in Thee and live, rather than
  live in a mirage-paradise of earthliness and die.

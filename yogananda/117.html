<div id="y117">
  O Spirit, beloved Father, Oversoul of the Universe, Spirit of Spirits, Friend of Friends: teach me the mystery of my
  existence! Teach me to worship Thee in breathlessness and in deathlessness. In the fire of devotion burn away my
  ignorance. In the stillness of my soulâ€”come, Spirit, come! Possess me and teach me to feel Thy immortal presence in
  and around me. Come, Spirit, come! Come, Spirit, come!

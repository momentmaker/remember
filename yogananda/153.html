  Bless me, that I may behold nothing but that which is good. Teach me, that I may touch only purity. Train me, that I
  may listen to Thy voice alone in all good speech, and in the beauty of all lovely melodies. Direct me to breathe
  only the perfume of pure scents from the flowers of Spirit. Invite me to indulge only in the wholesome taste of
  soul-nourishing food. Teach me to absorb only that which reminds me of Thee.

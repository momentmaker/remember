  In the furnace of trials the ore of my life is being purified. The fire of experience melts away all my delusionâ€™s
  dross. O Divine Artisan, burn away all my impurities; bring out in me the steel of endurance, and hone it to a fine
  edge by deep calmness. Forge in me, from the tempered steel of mental balance, sharp swords of self-control and firm
  tenacity. With the weapon of inner equilibrium, teach me to fight every enemy of distraction.

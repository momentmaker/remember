  Open our heart-bud to Thy love and let the fragrance of our love escape its prison of ego to merge in Thee. On winds
  of cosmic perception may our fragrance be swept to Thy temple of infinity.<br>
  <br>
  O King of all true ambition, throw open wide Thy windows everywhere: in the red cloud at sunset; in the rosy, glad
  clouds at dawn; in every charm-clad dream of human hopes. Open the doors of all noble aspirations that lead out from
  our ego-mansions onto the vast panorama of Thy Bliss.<br>
  <br>
  Let our fragrance blow with Thy breath, reminding all Nature of Thy unseen presence.

  The streamlets of our prayers rush out and conjoin with the well-springs of our hearts, uniting in a single, mighty
  flow. Our broad, deep-flowing rivers of prayer move swiftly toward Thy oceanic presence, breaking all narrow
  embankments of indifference, dissolving every eddy and large whirlpool of worldly desire, flowing freely over the
  protruding rocks of bad habits, and straightening the once-winding ways of delusion. Our great river of devotion
  crosses sands of human oblivion—uncounted lives, lost in eternity to present memory—and inundates every trace of
  past trials and painful past experience. Yet even now Thy shores seem far away! Doggedly, our flood moves on toward
  Thy sea of shining vastness.<br>
  <br>
  Pour, Thou, unceasingly the raindrops of Thy mercy, swelling the flood of our prayers that they reach at last,
  triumphantly, Thine ever-waiting shores!

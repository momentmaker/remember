<div id="y21">
  O Holy Vibration, boom on the shores of my consciousness. Break the limiting boundary of my body-consciousness.
  Reverberate through my body, mind, and soulâ€”through my surroundings, through all the cities and lands of this earth,
  through all the planets, throughout the universe and every atom-particle of Creation. Unite my consciousness with
  Thy cosmic consciousness.
</div>

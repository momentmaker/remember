<div id="y70">
  Make me an eagle of progress, soaring far above narrow lanes of bigotry. Call me to soar ever higher and higher, far
  above all clouds of earthly pettiness.<br>
  <br>
  With the sharp talons of my soul I will tear at the little squabbling birds of misery, which prey upon mankind. I
  will free my mindâ€™s skies from the buzzards of cynicism which prey on carcasses of dead hopes.<br>
  <br>
  I will soar on balanced wings of wholesome living, high up into the finest regions of divine perception. High above
  the hurricanes of earthly preoccupation, I will soar higher and higher to those unimagined heights where Thou alone
  dost dwell.<br>
  <br>
  Make me Thy eagle of ever-upward progress.

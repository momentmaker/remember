<div id="y124">
  May my spark commingle with Thy great spark. May it twinkle in all eyes. Bless me, that I may swim in the sea of
  souls. Let me rush with Thee on avalanches of noble desire. Let me feel Thee in the budding hopes of all roseate
  minds, and in the silence of all saints. Let the tears of my sympathy commingle with the drops in all tearful eyes.
  Together, Thou and I will dance on the wavelets of all feelings. We will cheer every heart with divine delight! Let us
  throb in the life of all beings.

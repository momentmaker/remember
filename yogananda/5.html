<div id="y5">
  When clouds of devastating war rain fire and death, I will not forget that Thou, O God, art my best Bomb-Shelter. In
  life and death, in disease, famine, pestilence, and poverty, I cling to Thee who alone canst show me that, in all
  dualities of life-experiences, my soul remains unharmed. Thou wilt ever protect me, and make me realize that I am
  immortal, untouched by the changing conditions of childhood, youth, and age, and of world conditions, whether in
  peace or in upheaval.

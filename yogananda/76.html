  The bee of silence has made its way to the garden of my heart, where murmuring thought-flowers hold out fragrant
  bouquets: lilies of discrimination, butter-cups of recipient prayers, chrysanthemums of soul-rays, and
  violet-dreams of love-offerings to Thee.<br>
  <br>
  There, in my heart’s bed of many flowers fanned by the sweet breeze of my love, where the fresh dew of Thy grace hides
  at the core of every flowering good quality, my eager mind-bee hovers in anticipation above these treasures of Thy
  love.<br>
  <br>
  O, teach me to abhor the flies of cruel sarcasm, which love to sit on the wounds of others, and thereby swell their
  troubles. Let me be a kind, friendly bee “robbing” only sweetness from the flower-hearts of all.

<div id="y12">
  The sun shines high in the heavens: everything is fully awake. Awaken Thou me, likewise! Thou art invisible, yet Thine
  energy flows through the rays of sunshine. Fill my veins with Thine invisible rays, making me strong and tireless. As
  the sun shines in the busiest streets, so may I behold Thy rays of protecting love in the crowded places of my lifeâ€™s
  activities. As the light shines steadily, undisturbed, on the street, whether crowded or empty, so may I hold my
  calmness and my strength steadily while I move through the crowded or empty streets of life. Give me strength. And
  what I receive, teach me to share with others.

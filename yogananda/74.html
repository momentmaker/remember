<div id="y74">
  I bled, spreading Thy name, and for Thy name’s sake I will ever bleed. With bloody limbs, broken body, wounded
  features, and bearing the thorn-crown of derision—yet like a mighty warrior will I fight undismayed, even there where
  the skirmish is thickest.<br>
  <br>
  With the sword of calmness I will stand firm against the hands of persecution. My disciplined armies of true
  aspiration, blowing trumpets in Thy name, now march in triumph to seize the dark kingdom of God-denying souls.<br>
  <br>
  No matter how many blows I receive, and no matter how often the swords of persecution pierce my heart, I am content in
  the realization that Thou knowest my craving to spread Thy name. I will wear my tribulations not as scars, but as
  medals given for courage, and as inspirations to strive ever harder in my fight against ignorance. O Lord! help me
  conquer darkness with Thy golden message of light.<br>
  <br>
  Be Thou, ever, the General in my invasion of the continent of ignorance!

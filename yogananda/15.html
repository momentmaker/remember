<div id="y15">
  Heavenly Father, receive this food. Make it holy. Let no impurity of greed defile it. The food comes from Thee. It
  is to build Thy temple. Spiritualize it. Spirit to Spirit goes. We are the petals of Thy manifestation, but Thou art
  the Flower, its life, beauty, and loveliness. Permeate our souls with the fragrance of Thy presence.

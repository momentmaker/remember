<div id="q15">
  Every sincere effort is registered in the Divine consciousness.<br>
  Your duty... is to accept whatever He sends you —<br>
  and, for that matter, He doesn’t send.<br>
  God alone knows what past karma keeps you from perceiving Him right now.<br>
  He may want you to finish up your karma in this life,<br>
  before giving you eternal bliss.

<div id="y142">
  Dressed in Thy luster, clean and holy, Thou didst send me out to play. I playedâ€”but in darkness, ignorantly; I found
  myself, therefore, lost in a mire of suffering. I went forth clean, but have come back to Thee all besmirched with the
  mud of delusion. O Divine Mother, wash me in Thy wisdom: Make me clean again!

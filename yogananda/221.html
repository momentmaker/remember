<div id="y221">
  Dear Heavenly Father, when I’m asleep, come to me as peace. When I’m awake, come to me as joy. When I give kindness to
  others, come to me as love. When I run, run with high energy through my legs. When I think, send understanding
  through my thoughts. When I use will power, send your will power through me. Teach me to think, play, behave, and use
  my will rightly, for Thou art always by me. I love to be guided by Thee, for Thou, more even than my parents, dost
  always wish the best for me.

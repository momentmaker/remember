  Whether soaring through the sky encased in a steel air-cage, or drawn oâ€™er the land by snorting iron steeds, or moving
  easily over smooth highways on rubber wheels, or having my very thoughts paralyzed by the pounding din of assembly
  lines, the compass needle of my attention will ever keep turning toward Thy magnetic North Pole of divine love.<br>
  <br>
  Beaten by winds of happenstance, drenched by cloudbursts of misery, sucked down in the mud of soul-enmeshing,
  ego-whipped activity, or wandering lost in jungles of confusion, my mind will yet ever reach out for Thy guiding
  touch.<br>
  <br>
  The raft of my life, tossed about helplessly by the driving storms of need, was drifting toward rocks of insatiable
  desire.<br>
  <br>
  O Polestar in our wisdom-skies, Thy twinkling light beckoned and directed me toward Thy shores of eternal contentment.
  Though countless mechanisms pound, twist, or stretch my anguished nerves, yet will the homing pigeon of my love wing
  its way peacefully toward its true home in Thee.

<div id="y62">
  Teach me to behave like the orange which, though crushed and bitten, never fails to impart its sweetness. Battered by
  unkindness, gnawed at by carping criticism, or hewn with hard words and cruel behavior, teach me yet to pour out
  unceasingly the sweetness of love.<br>
  <br>
  Teach me to be like soap-flakes which, when rubbed and beaten, give out only cleansing foam. Tried and tested by
  ingratitude, teach me nevertheless to offer, in return, the snow-white foam of wisdom.

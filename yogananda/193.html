  I drew apart the gross veils of earthly music, O Infinite Musician, and heard Thee playing through the sweet lilt of
  the violin, through the bright strumming of the harp, and I heard Thy song through the whispered longings of my own
  mind. O Magic Musician! plucking gently on the hidden feeling-strings of my heart, at last I beheld Thy soft, warm
  light spreading like dawn over the awakening sky of my mind. Thou Dearest of all singers, Thy notes have awakened me
  from the slumber of ages! I now stand before Thy altar, eager to offer Thee my own melodies, inspired by Thee.

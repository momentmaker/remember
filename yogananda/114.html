<div id="y114">
  O Divine Father, Thou art just behind my prayer: Why dost Thou seem so far away? Thou dost tremble in my feelings; Thy
  presence glimmers through the veil of my thoughts. Yet dost Thou seem so far away! Father, come! Remove Thy veil!
  Come, Father, come! Hear the voice of my prayer. I want to know Thee, to talk to Thee, to hear Thee speak to me. I
  want to pray to Thee and know that Thou dost hear my prayer. Show me the way that leads to Thee.

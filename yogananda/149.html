<div id="y149">
  I built a fire of devotion in the dark forest of delusion. Alas! the fire only smouldered. Then Thou didst come and
  set fire to a few of my frailties. That fire quickly spread, consuming the bushes of my prickly desires, my tall,
  towering vanities, and the thick underbrush of my arrogance. The whole forest of my darkness is blazing, and I behold
  only Thy light shining everywhere. I thank Thee, Father, for Thy help. Help me thus always. Let me open a path of
  light for all to follow!

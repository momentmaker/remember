  Through the long night of error we pursued the will-o’-the-wisp of false happiness. Gloom led only to deeper gloom;
  our feet, struggling to follow the path of progress, often slipped into ruts and struggled through marshes of
  disillusionment. The deceiving elmo’s fire of passions lures many people to their doom. Thousands are sucked down into
  the bog of sense satiety.<br>
  <br>
  O Divine Friend, extinguish with Thy breath this false light of destructive glee which has so often misled Thy
  children, headed for Thy home. Light instead Thy beacon of holy radiance, that every eager child-pilgrim safely reach
  Thy home.

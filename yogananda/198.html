  I, the nightingale of heaven, perched on the boughs of many lives, singing Thy songs.<br>
  <br>
  My clear song reverberates over soul-leaves that flutter with Thy life. It thrills the night air in the private
  gardens of centuries, where many sleep, dreaming sweet fantasies or, again, nightmares of delusion. It wakens some
  of them with soft touches of Thy reverberating, cosmic song.<br>
  <br>
  I fly everywhere, and give concerts to express Thy joy in bowers of receptive hearts. Oh! I will come again and again
  to lure all souls with my songs, and to teach them Thy songs, and invite them all to fly, like me, in Thy skies of
  cosmic freedom.

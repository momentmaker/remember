<div id="y210">
  I plucked blossoms of light from dawn’s heart as offerings to Thee. I have lighted lamps of wakefulness in the temple
  of my morning’s silence.<br>
  <br>
  I beheld Thy bliss-face emerge from the dark shadows of my ignorance, where it had been hidden for long aeons by my
  indifference. And, seeing Thy smiling joy, I know that my own happiness mirrored Thy blessed image. My heart’s
  tiny capacity for love mirrored Thy infinite love. My little peace of mind mirrored Thy awe-inspiring, majestic
  calmness.<br>
  <br>
  I will blame the fates no longer for any suffering that comes my way. Beloved Divine Mother, it was my self-made
  darkness that hid the glory of our mutual love. Now I see myself reflected in Thy bliss, and know that I, too, am
  perfect bliss. For my own mirror is clear, now; I behold Thy reflection in it, O Thou ever-sacred, omnipresent,
  perfect bliss!<br>
  <br>
  I pour libations of my love at Thy feet of immortality! I pour out my heart to Thee from the overflowing chalice of my
  soul! I wash with the precious musk of my reverence Thy feet of ever-moving progress in everything.

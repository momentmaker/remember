<div id="y195">
  Through long, winding pathways of self-doubt, fording mighty rivers that separated Thee from me, trudging over endless
  wastes of barren lives, tossing dangerously on the rapids of many ambitions, arduously climbing steep mountain trails
  of desire, and carefully extricating myself from whirlpools of alternating sadness and hilarity—at last I have
  reached my journey’s end. I look upon all those past travails with joy. Every struggle, every past agony, has produced
  a flowing spring of joyous, grateful tears. In the sacred waters of those tears, I baptize myself daily with deep love
  for Thee.

<div id="y80">
  Teach me, O Spirit, to distinguish between my soulâ€™s lasting happiness and the temporary pleasures of the senses:
  touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Strengthen my will power. Teach me not to be enslaved by bad habits. Teach me
  to be guided only by good habits, formed by good company and meditation. Teach me above all to be guided by Thy
  wisdom. Teach me to shun evil by right judgment and discrimination. Teach me willingly to adopt all good ways,
  influenced only by inner freedom, and not compelled to evil by hardened habits.

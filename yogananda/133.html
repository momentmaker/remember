<div id="y133">
  Let the waves of Thy power dance on the river of my activity. As Thou art intelligently busy making atoms, flowers,
  universes, so teach me to be cheerfully busy always. Thou art ever busy yet eternally smiling in joyous hearts. Bless
  me, that I may wear Thy unfading smile as I work in the factory of life.

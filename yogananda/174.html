  My finiteness has gone to rest, cradled in Thy arms of infinite perception. Noisy sense impressions quieted at the
  sound of Thy softly approaching tread of inner peace.<br>
  <br>
  Calming my breath, wakeful in higher awareness, I sat, still-ly waiting.<br>
  <br>
  Inner sounds—soul-melodies—burst out in welcome to Thy majestic coming, O King Silence, with Thy approach to my peace-
  decked meditation chamber.<br>
  <br>
  In the darkness, hidden diamond-chips of broken dreams dimly glittered, hinting at the blazing glory of Thine
  approach. I gathered all my sacred aspirations, and tied them together into a single bouquet with strings of
  countless graces that I had received from Thee. Then I offered that bouquet at Thy feet. Lo! My humble offering was
  transformed into a bouquet of gold! With this gold will I construct a shining, ever-enduring temple in my soul,
  wherein I will sit on Thy throne of peace.

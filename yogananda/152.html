<div id="y152">
  O Divine Teacher, train me to recognize the difference between my soulâ€™s lasting happiness and the passing pleasures
  of the senses. Keep my eyes open that I be not deceived by my senses, decked out as they are in stolen royal trappings
  and in the mirage-cloak of false happiness as, thus disguised, they try to enter the mansion of my life.<br>
  <br>
  Discipline my unwise, wayward senses that my pleasures be spiritualized, and that I look ever beyond the illusion of
  glittering, visible forms to find divine joy hidden, simply dressed in the white robe of humility.

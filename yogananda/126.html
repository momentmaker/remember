<div id="y126">
  Teach me to descend as rain drops on thirsty soul-flowers, showering them with Thy nectar-name. Teach me to dream with
  the poppy petals dreams of Thy golden light and inner peace. O Divine Breath, blow with me as the little breath in all
  men, and as the vast breath of all living things.

  Thou Master Piper, blow Thy music through the reed of all religions—so often broken by sectarian selfishness—and
  bring forth Thy one theme of truth. Dress that divine melody with many golden chords, showing the richness of Thy
  Spirit.<br>
  <br>
  And, O Master Piper! gather together, from all the highways and byways of truth’s numerous expressions, all the
  uncompleted songs of lonely hearts seeking attunement with Thee, and let them flow into complete melodies of joy
  through the love-playing flute of life!<br>
  <br>
  On my silence-tuned radio-mind I listened daily for Thy thrilling, anciently familiar flute notes. I tried to tune
  in to them, but Thou seemedst so far, far away, and at first the busy static of restlessness crackled in my silence.
  Then at last, however, with a few fine, careful touches of concentration, I heard a soft rustling sound, as if on
  wings of space. And suddenly I heard Thee piping softly, then more loudly and ever-more loudly, with a swelling chorus
  of all earth’s goodness and the latent nobility in all hearts.

<div id="y23">
  No more shall my consciousness remain bottled in this little vessel of flesh, corked with ignorance. No more will I
  remain moving through the sea of cosmic consciousness—night and day, years, decades, and how many incarnations!—so
  close, yet never able to contact Thy sea. Through the bursting vibration of cosmic sound and the surging of Thy holy
  name, I have removed the cork of ignorance which so long separated me from Thee, though we lived together so closely!
  Now my body-consciousness will meet Thy all-surrounding, all-pervading consciousness. No longer will I walk
  heedlessly, in Thee, but never knowing and feeling Thee. Thine image within me shall meet Thine image everywhere. By
  releasing the “I-ness” in me, I will know that I am Thou, and that Thou alone art the little egos of us all.

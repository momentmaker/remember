  Rule of 7 in research:<br>
  You can find out anything<br>
  if you are willing to go seven levels.<br>
  If the first source you ask doesn’t know<br>
  ask them who you should ask next<br>
  and so on down the line.<br>
  If you are willing to go to the seventh source<br>
  you’ll almost always get your answer.

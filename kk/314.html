<div id="k314">
  Explore or optimize?<br>
  Do you optimize what you know will sell<br>
  or explore with something new?<br>
  Do you order a restaurant dish<br>
  you are sure is great (optimize)<br>
  or do you try something new?<br>
  Do you keep dating new folks (explore)<br>
  or try to commit to someone you met?<br>
  The ideal balance for exploring new things<br>
  vs. optimizing those already found<br>
  is ⅓.<br>
  Spend ⅓ of your time on exploring and<br>
  ⅔ on optimizing and deepening.<br>
  As you mature it is harder to devote time<br>
  to exploring because it seems unproductive<br>
  but aim for ⅓.

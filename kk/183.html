<div id="k183">
  Children totally accept<br>
  —and crave—family rules.<br>
  “In our family we have a rule for X”<br>
  is the only excuse a parent needs<br>
  for setting a family policy.<br>
  In fact, “I have a rule for X”<br>
  is the only excuse you need<br>
  for your own personal policies.

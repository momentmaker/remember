  Your golden ticket<br>
  is being able to see things<br>
  from other peopleâ€™s point of view.<br>
  This shift enables heartfelt empathy.<br>
  It also allows you to persuade others<br>
  and it is the key to great design.<br>
  Mastering the view through the eyes of others<br>
  will unlock so many doors.

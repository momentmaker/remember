<div id="k347">
  A superpower worth cultivating<br>
  is learning from people you don’t like.<br>
  It is called “humility.”<br>
  This is the courage<br>
  to let dumb, stupid, hateful, crazy, mean<br>
  people teach you something<br>
  because despite their character flaws<br>
  they each know something you don’t.

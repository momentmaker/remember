<div id="#k263">
  When you’re checking references for a job<br>
  applicant, their employer may be prohibited<br>
  from saying anything negative<br>
  so leave or send a message that says<br>
  “Get back to me if you highly recommend<br>
  this applicant as super great.”<br>
  If they don’t reply, take that as a negative.

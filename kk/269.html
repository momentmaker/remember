<div id="#k269">
  When you have some success, the feeling of<br>
  being an imposter can be real.<br>
  Who am I fooling?<br>
  But when you create things that only you<br>
  with your unique talents<br>
  and experience can do<br>
  then you are absolutely not an imposter.<br>
  You are the ordained.<br>
  It is your destiny to work<br>
  on things that only you can do.

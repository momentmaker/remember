  The best way to untangle a knotty tangle is<br>
  not to “untie” the knots but to keep pulling<br>
  the loops apart wider and wider. Just make<br>
  the mess as big, loose, and open as possible.<br>
  As you open up the knots, they will unravel<br>
  themselves. Works on cords, strings, hoses<br>
  yarns, or electronic cables.

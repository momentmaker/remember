<div id="#k99">
  Following your bliss<br>
  is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know<br>
  what you are passionate about.<br>
  A better path for most youth is<br>
  “master something.”<br>
  Through mastery of one thing<br>
  you’ll command a viewpoint<br>
  to steadily find where your bliss is.

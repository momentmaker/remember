<div id="k82">
  On vacation go to the most remote place on<br>
  your itinerary first<br>
  bypassing the cities<br>
  and then return to the big city at the end.<br>
  You’ll maximize the shock of otherness in<br>
  the remote, and then later<br>
  you’ll welcome the familiar conveniences of a<br>
  busy city on the way back.

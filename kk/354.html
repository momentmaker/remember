<div id="k354">
  The main reason<br>
  to produce something every day<br>
  is that you must throw away<br>
  a lot of good work to reach the great stuff.<br>
  To let it all go easily<br>
  you need to be convinced that<br>
  there is “more where that came from.”<br>
  You get that in steady production.

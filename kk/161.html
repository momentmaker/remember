  Money is overrated.<br>
  Truly new things rarely need an abundance<br>
  of money. If that was so, billionaires<br>
  would have a monopoly on inventing new<br>
  things, and they donâ€™t. Instead, almost all<br>
  breakthroughs are made by those who<br>
  lack money. If breakthroughs could be<br>
  bought, then the rich would buy them.<br>
  Instead, passion, persistence, belief, and<br>
  ingenuity are required to invent new things<br>
  qualities the poor and young often have in<br>
  abundance. Stay hungry.

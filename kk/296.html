<div id="#k296">
  It’s possible that a not-so-smart person<br>
  who can communicate well<br>
  can do much better than a super-smart<br>
  person who can’t communicate well.<br>
  That is good news<br>
  because it is much easier<br>
  to improve your communication skills<br>
  than your intelligence.

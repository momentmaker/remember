<div id="#k47">
  When you are young, spend<br>
  at least 6 months to 1 year<br>
  living as cheaply as you can<br>
  owning as little as you possibly can<br>
  eating beans and rice in a tiny room<br>
  or tent.<br>
  That way any time you have to risk<br>
  something in the future, you won’t be afraid<br>
  of the “worst-case” scenario.

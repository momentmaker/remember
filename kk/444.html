<div id="#k444">
  Commit to doing no work<br>
  no business<br>
  no income one day a week.<br>
  Call it a sabbath (or not).<br>
  Use that day for resting, recharging, and cultivating<br>
  the most important things in life.<br>
  Counterintuitively, this sabbath will prove<br>
  to be your most productive act all week.

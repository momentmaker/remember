<div id="#k291">
  What you actually pay for something<br>
  can be twice the listed price<br>
  because the energy, time, and money needed<br>
  to set it up, learn, maintain, repair it<br>
  and then dispose of it when done<br>
  all have their own cost.<br>
  Not all prices appear on labels.
</div>

  Assume anyone asking for your account<br>
  information for any reason<br>
  is guilty of scamming you<br>
  unless proven innocent.<br>
  The way to prove innocence is to call<br>
  them back, or log in to your account using<br>
  numbers or a website that you provide<br>
  not them. Donâ€™t release any identifying<br>
  information while they are contacting you<br>
  via phone, message, or email.<br>
  You must control the channel.

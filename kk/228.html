  Courtesy costs nothing.<br>
  When you borrow something, return it<br>
  cleaned. Lower the toilet seat after use.<br>
  Let the car in front of you merge. Return<br>
  shopping carts to their designated areas.<br>
  Let the people in the elevator<br>
  exit before you enter.<br>
  These courtesies are free.

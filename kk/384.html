<div id="k384">
  Your flaws and your strengths<br>
  are two poles of the same traits.<br>
  For instance, there is only<br>
  a tiny difference between<br>
  stubbornness and perseverance<br>
  or between courage and foolishness.<br>
  The sole difference is in the goal.<br>
  Itâ€™s stupid stubbornness<br>
  and reckless foolishness<br>
  if the goal does not matter, and<br>
  relentless perseverance and<br>
  courage if it does.<br>
  To earn dignity with your flaws<br>
  own up to them, and<br>
  make sure you push on things that matter.

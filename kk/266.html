<div id="k266">
  Keep all your things visible<br>
  in a hotel room, not in drawers<br>
  and all gathered into one spot. That way<br>
  youâ€™ll never leave anything behind.<br>
  If you need to have something like a<br>
  charger off to the side<br>
  place a couple of other large items next to<br>
  it, because you are less likely<br>
  to leave three items behind than just one.

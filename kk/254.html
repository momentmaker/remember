<div id="#k254">
  When you feel like quitting<br>
  just do five more:<br>
  5 more minutes, 5 more pages<br>
  5 more steps. Then repeat. Sometimes<br>
  you can break through and keep going<br>
  but even if you canâ€™t, you ended five ahead.<br>
  Tell yourself that you will quit tomorrow<br>
  but not today.

<div id="k281">
  We tend to overestimate<br>
  what we can do in a day<br>
  and underestimate<br>
  what we can achieve in a decade.<br>
  Miraculous things can be accomplished<br>
  if you give it 10 years.<br>
  A long game will compound small gains<br>
  that will be able to overcome<br>
  even big mistakes.

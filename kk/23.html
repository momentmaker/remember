<div id="#k23">
  Never use a credit card for credit.<br>
  The only kind of credit, or debt<br>
  that is acceptable<br>
  is debt to acquire something<br>
  whose exchange value<br>
  is extremely likely to increase<br>
  like a home.<br>
  The exchange value of most things<br>
  diminishes<br>
  or vanishes the moment<br>
  you purchase them.<br>
  Donâ€™t be in debt to losers.

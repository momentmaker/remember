<div id="k318">
  When someone tells you<br>
  about the peak year of human history<br>
  the period of time when things were good<br>
  before things went downhill<br>
  it will always be the year<br>
  when they were 10 years old—<br>
  which is the peak of any human’s existence.<br>
  Factor that into what they say.

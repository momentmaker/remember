<div id="k330">
  The best time to negotiate your salary<br>
  for a new job is the moment after<br>
  they say they want you<br>
  and not before.<br>
  Then it becomes a game of chicken<br>
  for each side to name an amount first<br>
  but it is to your advantage<br>
  to get them to give a number before you do.

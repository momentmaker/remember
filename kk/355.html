<div id="k355">
  The real test of your character<br>
  is not how you deal with adversityâ€”<br>
  although that will teach you much.<br>
  The real test is how you deal with power.<br>
  The only cure for power is humility<br>
  and the admission that<br>
  your power comes from luck.<br>
  The small person believes they are superior;<br>
  the superior person knows they are lucky.

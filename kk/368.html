<div id="k368">
  To meditate, sit<br>
  and pay attention to your breathing.<br>
  Your mind will wander to thoughts.<br>
  Then you bring your attention back<br>
  to your breathing<br>
  where it canâ€™t think.<br>
  Wander. Retreat.<br>
  Keep returning to breath<br>
  no thoughts.<br>
  That is all.

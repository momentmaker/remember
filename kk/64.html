<div id="k64">
  Separate the processes of creating<br>
  from improving.<br>
  You can’t write and edit<br>
  or sculpt and polish<br>
  or make and analyze at the same time.<br>
  If you do, the editor stops the creator.<br>
  While you invent, don’t select.<br>
  While you sketch, don’t inspect.<br>
  While you write the first draft, don’t reflect.<br>
  At the start, the creator mind must be<br>
  unleashed from judgment.

<div id="h26">
  The human world represents a purgatorial-like range of opportunities and choices, from the most grim to the exalted,
  from criminality to nobility, from fear to courage, from despair to hope, and from greed to charity. Thus, if the
  purpose of the human experience is to evolve, then this world is perfect just as it is.

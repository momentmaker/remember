  Although inherent to consciousness itself, context is usually not stated, identified, or defined. Therefore, there has
  previously been no actual science of truth itself, much less a means of verification or confirmation. So it is
  inevitable that humanity flounders and repetitively falls into endless disasters (such as repeating the same mistake
  over and over, hoping for a different result).

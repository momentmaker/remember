<div id="h19">
  Everything in the universe constantly gives off an identifiable energy pattern of a specific frequency that remains
  for all time and can be read by those who know how. Every word, deed, and intention creates a permanent record; every
  thought is known and recorded forever. There are no secrets; nothing is hidden, nor can it be. Everyone lives in the
  public domain. Our spirits stand naked in time for all to see. Everyoneâ€™s life, finally, is accountable to the
  universe.

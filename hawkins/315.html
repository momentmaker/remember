  The ego often seems to collapse in a piecemeal fashion. Once faith in the reality of the ego as being the true self is
  undermined, its dissolution has already begun. When one’s loyalty and allegiance is shifted from the ego to the
  ultimate reality of God, a space is created. Into the opening flows God’s Grace as represented by the Holy Spirit.

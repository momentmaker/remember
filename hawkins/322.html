<div id="h322">
  This process of spirituality, in which one works through the obstacles, may seem painful at times, but it is only
  transitional. The mistakes now reappear and are recontextualized from a higher understanding. This process is
  shortened and less painful if it is realized that habitual responses are not truly personal, but are part and parcel
  of the inheritance of being human.

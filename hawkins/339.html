  The basic purpose of spiritual work and dedication is to transcend the innate evolutionary limitations of the ego and
  thereby access and develop the nascent capacity of consciousness itself, which bypasses all the limitations of the
  ego/self. Truth then presents itself by virtue of Divine Grace. Divinity reveals Itself to those who call upon It in
  Godâ€™s time. The pace of spiritual evolution can seem slow, but spiritual endeavor is never futile. Progress can become
  very sudden and very major in dimension and impact.

  The source of resistance to spiritual endeavor is the narcissistic core of the ego itself, which secretly claims
  sovereignty and authorship of one’s existence, decisions, and actions. Thus, despite one’s best efforts, willfulness
  and desire for gain or control have continued to erupt repetitiously.<br>
  <br>
  This pattern can be diminished simply by accepting that it is natural for the ego to be vain, greedy, hateful,
  prideful, resentful, envious, and more. These were learned accretions to the ego during its evolutionary development
  over eons of time. Therefore, it is not necessary to feel guilty because these primitive emotions merely need to be
  outgrown and discarded in the transition from self-interest to Self-interest.

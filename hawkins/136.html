<div id="h136">
  Without consciousness, there would be nothing to experience form. It could also be said that form itself—as a product
  of perception with no independent existence—is thus transitory and limited, whereas consciousness is all-encompassing
  and unlimited. How could that which is transitory (with a clear beginning and ending), create that which is formless
  (all encompassing and unlimited)? However, if we see that the notion of limitation itself is merely a product of
  perception with no intrinsic reality, then the riddle solves itself: form becomes an expression of the formless.

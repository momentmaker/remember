  Q: What does “surrender to God” really mean?<br>
  <br>
  A: It means to surrender control and the secret satisfactions of the ego’s positionalities. Turn only to love and to
  God as the source of life and joy. This choice is available in every instant. When finally chosen, the reward is
  great. By invitation, spiritual awareness illuminates the way. The key is willingness.

<div id="h107">
  Nothing in the universe happens by chance or accident. The universe is a coherent concurrence and interaction of
  innumerable conditions attendant on the infinite number of energy patterns. In the state of awareness, all this is
  obvious and can be clearly seen and known. Outside that level of awareness, it could be likened to innumerable,
  invisible magnetic fields that automatically coalesce or repel oneâ€™s position, and which interact according to the
  positions and relative strengths and polarities. Everything influences everything else and is in perfect balance.

<div id="h271">
  Attachment is the process whereby the suffering of loss occurs, irrespective of what the attachment is to or about:
  whether internal or external; whether object, relationship, social quality, or aspects of physical life. The ego
  perpetuates itself through its elaborate network of values, belief systems, and programs. Needs thus arise that gain
  more energy as they become embellished and elaborated, sometimes to the point of fixation.<br>
  <br>
  The source of pain is not the belief system itself but one’s attachment to it and the inflation of its imaginary
  value. The inner processing of attachments is dependent on the exercise of the will, which alone has the power to undo
  the mechanism of attachment by the process of surrender. This may be subjectively experienced or contextualized as
  sacrifice, although it is actually a liberation. The emotional pain of loss arises from the attachment itself and not
  from the “what” that has been lost.

  Attachment is a very peculiar quality of the ego. It can be totally undone in all of its pervasive and multitudinous
  forms of clinging by simply letting go of one’s faith in it, or belief in its value as a reality. The attachment to
  “self” or “me” or “I” is a basic trap. One can seek out its fantasy value—the self gets attached to what it
  values.<br>
  <br>
  Note that attachment requires and is sustained by an energy and an intention. The mind is attached to the very process
  of attachment itself as a survival tool. Letting go of the ego is based on the willingness to surrender attachment to
  it as a substitute for God.

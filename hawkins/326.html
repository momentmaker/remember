<div id="h326">
  Spiritual reality is a greater source of pleasure and satisfaction than the world can supply. It is endless and always
  available in the present instead of the future. It is actually more exciting because one learns to live on the crest
  of the current moment, instead of on the back of the wave (which is the past) or on the front of the wave (which is
  the future). There is greater freedom from living on the exciting knife-edge of the moment than being a prisoner of
  the past or having expectations of the future.

<div id="h325">
  To spiritualize one’s life, it is necessary only to shift one’s motive. To constantly be aware of one’s actual motive
  tends to bring up positionality and pairs of opposites, such as gain versus service or love versus greed. These then
  become visible and are available for spiritual work because one is now conscious of them.

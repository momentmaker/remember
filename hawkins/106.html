  In Reality, everything occurs of its own, with no exterior cause. Every thing and every event is a manifestation of
  the totality of All That Is, just as it is at any given moment. Once seen in its totality, everything is perfect at
  all times, and nothing needs an external cause to change it in any way. From the viewpoint of the egoâ€™s positionality
  and limited scope, the world seems to need endless fixing and correction. This illusion collapses as a vanity.

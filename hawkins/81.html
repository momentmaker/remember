  Awareness of the overall silent contextual field is facilitated by a contemplative lifestyle that could be likened to
  shifting interest from details to “the big picture.” It “gets” overall qualities of atmosphere without going into
  specifics, and therefore intuits generalities rather than thinking or analyzing.<br>
  <br>
  The resistance of the ego/mind is that it is afraid it might “miss” something, as it is addicted to processing the
  details of the content of form, which is the attraction and lure of the world. To “renounce the world” means to
  withdraw energy from it and decline activities that require attention to specifics, thereby abiding in the Self rather
  than in the amusements of the self.

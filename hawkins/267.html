<div id="h267">
  What the world ignores as a weed is of beauty equal to that of the flower. The living-sculpture design of all nature
  is equal, without classification, and everything is realized to be of the same merit or worth. All is an expression of
  Divinity as creationâ€”all is equally sacred and holy.

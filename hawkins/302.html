<div id="h302">
  One makes a gift of one’s life and endeavors by sanctifying them with love, devotion, and selfless service. That is
  the way of the heart to God. In that way, domestic life becomes a form of worship and the source of joy to all. When
  one seeks to uplift others, everyone is uplifted in the process. Giving is therefore self-rewarding, for there is
  actually no “other” that is being given to. Every kind thought or smile is therefore spiritual and benefits oneself as
  well as all the world.

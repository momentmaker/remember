  The world is actually entertainment. Like amusement, it is meant to be worn lightly. Heaven is within and is revealed
  by awareness. The world is merely an appearance. Its melodrama is an artifice of the distorted sense of perception. It
  leads one to think that the world is large, powerful, and permanent and that the Self is small, weak, and transitory;
  exactly the opposite is true.

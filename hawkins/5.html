  The infinite field of consciousness is All Present, All Powerful, and includes All of Existence. Thus, nothing can
  possibly happen outside its infinite domain because it is the Source of Existence. Within this infinite field of
  power, there are decreasing levels of energy fields. As they are expressed progressively in form (linearity), their
  relative power decreases all the way down to the individual.<br>
  <br>
  The giant field could be compared to an immense electrostatic field in which the individual is like a charged particle
  that, because of the infinite power of the field, is automatically aligned within the field according to its
  individual “charge.” The charge of the karmic spiritual body is set by intention, decision, and alignment by
  intention.<br>

  It appears to naïve perception that what is not intellectually explicable seems to be “accidental,” especially when
  the event is unpredictable. Inasmuch as the infinite field of consciousness is unlimited in dimension, nothing can
  happen outside of it. All that occurs within it is under its influence, and therefore, nothing “accidental” is
  possible in reality.

  The ego/mind presumes and is convinced that its perceptions and interpretations of life experiences are the “real”
  thing and therefore “true.” It also believes by projection that other people see, think, and feel the same way; and if
  they do not, they are mistaken and therefore wrong. Thus, perception reinforces its hold by reification and
  presumptions.

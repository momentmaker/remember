<div id="h140">
  God’s grace could be understood as the absolute certainty of the karmic coherence of the entire universe in all its
  expressions as realms and possibilities. Grace is the provision within the realm of consciousness, for the
  availability to use all the means to salvation and absolute freedom. By choice, one determines one’s own fate. There
  are no arbitrary forces to be reckoned with.

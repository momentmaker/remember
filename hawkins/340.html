  Spiritual evolution is a lifetime commitment and a way of life by which the world and all experience subserve
  spiritual intention. There is no greater calling than to choose to be a servant of God. With spiritual progress, each
  increment is of equal importanceâ€”for, analogously, it is only through the removal of a single brick that an entire
  wall collapses, and the seemingly impossible becomes possible.

  By committing to inner honesty, it will become apparent that the underpinning of the egoâ€™s responses is the pleasure
  that is derived from them. There is an inner satisfaction that is the payoff of self-pity, anger, rage, hate, pride,
  guilt, fear, and the like. This inner pleasure, as morbid as it may sound, energizes and propagates all these
  emotions. To undo their influence, it is merely necessary to be willing to forego and surrender these questionable,
  inner secret pleasures to God and to look to God only for joy and happiness.

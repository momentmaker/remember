<div id="h215">
  Meaning is so important that when life loses meaning, suicide commonly ensues. When life loses meaning, we first go
  into depression; when life becomes sufficiently meaningless, we leave it altogether. Force has transient goals; when
  those goals are reached, the emptiness of meaninglessness remains. Power, on the other hand, motivates us endlessly.
  If our lives are dedicated, for instance, to enhancing the welfare of everyone we contact, our lives can never lose
  meaning.

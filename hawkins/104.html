  Objectively, it can be seen that thoughts really belong to the consciousness of the world; the individual mind merely
  processes them in new combinations and permutations. What seem to be truly original thoughts appear only through the
  medium of genius and are invariably felt by their authors to be a gift, found or given, not self-created. It may be
  the case that we’re each unique, as no two snowflakes are alike . . . however, we’re still just snowflakes.

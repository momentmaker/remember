  In this interconnected universe, every improvement we make in our private world improves the world at large for
  everyone. We all float on the collective level of consciousness of mankind so that any increment we add comes back to
  us. We all add to our common buoyancy by our efforts to benefit life. What we do to serve life automatically benefits
  all of us because we are all included in that which is life. We are life. It’s a scientific fact that “what is good
  for you is good for me.”

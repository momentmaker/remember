  Along the spiritual pathway, blocks and temptations appear, as do doubts and fears. Classically, they have been termed
  the “tests” that arise from the ego, which does not relish relinquishment of dominion. These are overcome by
  reaffirmation of goals and commitment, as well as by reinforcing counterbalancing principles such as dedication,
  tenacity, constancy, courage, conviction, and intention. The greater the challenge, the greater the development of
  inner strength, decision, and determination. By persistence and discipline, it can be seen that temptation is an
  option to merely refuse rather than an impulse that calls for attack or negation.

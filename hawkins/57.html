  One is not “forced” to feel resentment by a negative memory, nor does one have to buy into a fearful thought about the
  future. These are only options. The mind is like a television set running its various channels for selection, and one
  does not have to follow any particular temptation of thought. One can fall into the temptation of feeling sorry for
  oneself, or feeling angry or worried. The secret attraction of all these options is that they offer an inner payoff or
  a secret satisfaction that is the source of the attraction of the mind’s thoughts.

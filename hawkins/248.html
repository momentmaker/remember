<div id="h248">
  The true source of joy and happiness is the realization of one’s existence in this very moment. The source of pleasure
  always comes from within, even though it is occasioned by some external event or acquisition. In any one instant of
  time, no such thing as a problem can exist. Unhappiness arises from going beyond the reality of the now and creating a
  story out of the past or the future— which, because neither exists, has no reality.

  If we examine much of what the world traditionally calls “evil,” what we discover is not evil, which is an
  abstraction, epithet, and label. Instead, we see behaviors that could be described as primitive, infantile,
  egotistical, narcissistic, selfish, and ignorant, complicated by the psychological mechanisms of denial, projection,
  and paranoia in order to justify hatred.

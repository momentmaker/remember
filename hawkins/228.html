  Love is misunderstood to be an emotion; actually, it is a state of awareness, a way of being in the world, a way of
  seeing oneself and others. Love for God or nature or even oneâ€™s pets opens the door to spiritual inspiration. The
  desire to make others happy overrides selfishness. The more we give love, the greater our capacity to do so becomes.
  It is a good beginning practice to merely mentally wish others well throughout the course of the day. Love blossoms
  into lovingness, which becomes progressively more intense, nonselective, and joyful.

  By observation, one will see that the good/bad dichotomy is merely the reflection of an overall contextualization
  based on unexamined presumptions. With deep humility, one will soon realize that unaided, the mind is really
  unauthorized, ill equipped, and incapable of making such judgmental discernment. It can make this discovery by just
  beginning to ask for whom is it good, for whom is it bad, when, and under what circumstances. This eventually leads to
  examining oneâ€™s overall contextualization of the significance and meaning of human life itself as a transitional
  learning experience.

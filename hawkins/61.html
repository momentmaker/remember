  The experience of the presence of God is available and within at all times, but awaits choice. That choice is made
  only by surrendering everything other than peace and love to God. In return, the Divinity of the Self reveals Itself
  as ever present—but not experienced—because it has been ignored or forgotten, or one has chosen otherwise.

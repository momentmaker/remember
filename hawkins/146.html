  Q: What is the most serviceable presumptive view of the worldfor a spiritual student/devotee/seeker?<br>
  <br>
  A: Presume that the world’s actual “purpose” is perfect and fully known only by God. See it as neutral overall, but
  with the benefit that it provides optimal opportunity for spiritual growth and the evolution of consciousness. It is a
  school for enlightenment and the revelation of Divinity, whereby consciousness/ awareness reawakens to its source.
  Thus, to pursue enlightenment in and of itself serves the world and God.

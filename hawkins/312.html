<div id="h312">
  Realization is not a “gain” or an accomplishment, nor is it something that is “given” as a reward for being good.
  These are all notions from childhood. God is immutable and cannot be manipulated into granting favors or seduced by
  bargaining or adulation. Worship benefits the worshipper by reinforcing commitment and inspiration. God is still,
  silent, and unmoving.

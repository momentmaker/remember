  The ego gets a grim pleasure and satisfaction from suffering and all the dishonest levels of pride, anger, desire,
  guilt, shame, and grief. The secret pleasure of suffering is addictive. Many people devote their entire lives to it
  and encourage others to follow suit. To stop this mechanism, the pleasure of the payoff has to be identified and
  willingly surrendered to God. Out of shame, the ego blocks out conscious awareness of its machinations, especially the
  secretiveness of the game of “victim.”

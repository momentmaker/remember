  As the true source of happiness stems from within, desire cannot be satisfiedâ€”it is a constant projection of
  specialness onto the external, and is thus the pursuit of a fantasy. As one desire becomes fulfilled and satisfied,
  the focus then moves on to the next object of desire in an endless procession, like a carrot on a stick.

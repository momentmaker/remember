  Q: How can one facilitate progress?<br>
  <br>
  A: That is a natural curiosity. Choice results in proclivities that become habitual mind-sets of attention. Within
  each moment are all of the necessary elements for realization. Look for essence rather than just appearance.
  Everything is perfect if seen as it really is. Everything is exactly the way it is “supposed to be,” whether it is
  shiny and new or rusty and dusty.<br>
  <br>
  Avoid adjectives, for they are all projected, mentalized qualifications. Later, you can even drop verbs and adverbs,
  for nothing is actually “doing” anything; it just innatelyis.Transition is a phenomenon that stems from within the
  observer, who sees sequence as a verb. If seen in less than 1/10,000th of a second, everything appears to be
  stationary.

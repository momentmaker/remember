  Q: Where is the reality of eternal truth to be found?<br>
  <br>
  A: Begin by accepting the very important statement that all truth is subjective. Do not waste lifetimes looking for an
  objective truth because no such thing exists. Even if it did, it could not be found except by the purely subjective
  experience of it. All knowledge and wisdom are subjective. Nothing can be said to exist unless it is subjectively
  experienced.

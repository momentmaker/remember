  The average person’s psyche is overwhelmed by layers of programmed belief systems of which they are unaware. Out of
  naïveté and the belief in the principles of causality, the supposed causes and their solutions are sought “out there.”
  With maturity and the wisdom of spirituality, the search becomes directed inwardly, where the source and resolution
  are finally discovered.

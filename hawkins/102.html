  As the ego’s dominance of perception recedes, so does the appearance of the world and the mind’s interpretations.
  Decisions are based on projected perceptions. Thus, the mind perceives endless illusions, including classifications
  based on judgments. Those that are interpreted as “good” options are attractive to choice and agreement. Therefore,
  all perceptions reflect content.

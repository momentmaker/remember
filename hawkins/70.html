  Inner satisfaction becomes more important than worldly gain or the desire to control or influence others. Attraction
  replaces promotion. Eventually, resistance is no longer related to worldly life and its perceived values. Instead, the
  inner intention is one of purity and selflessness. Thus, evolution becomes the consequence of the process itself
  rather than a consequence of “seekingness” or acquisition.

  The most important element in facilitating an upward movement in consciousness is an attitude of willingness, which
  opens up the mind through new means of appraisal to the possible validity of new hypotheses. Although motives for
  change are as multitudinous as the innumerable facets of the human condition, they are most often found to arise
  spontaneously when the mind is challenged in the face of a puzzle or a paradox. In fact, certain disciplines (such as
  Zen) deliberately create such an impasse in order to finesse a leap of awareness.

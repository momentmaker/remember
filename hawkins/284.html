<div id="h284">
  Like matter and energy, life cannot be destroyed but can only change form. Thus, death is actually only the leaving of
  the body. The sense of identity is, however, unbroken. The state of “me” (self) is constant and continues after it
  separates from the physical expiration; that is, there has to be a “who” that goes on to heaven or other realms or
  chooses to reincarnate.

  The ego clings to emotionality, which is intimately connected with its positionalities; it pretends to think that it
  has no other choices. To “surrender to God” means to stop looking to the ego for solace and thrills and to discover
  the endless, serene joy of peace. To look within is to find the underlying, ever-present source of the illumination of
  the mind itself.

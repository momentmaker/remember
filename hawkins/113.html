  In Reality, everything is automatically manifesting the inherent destiny of its essence; it doesn’t need any external
  help to do this. With humility, one can relinquish the ego’s self-appointed role as savior of the world and surrender
  it straight to God. The world that the ego pictures is a projection of its own illusions and arbitrary
  positionalities. No such world exists.

  It is unrealistic as well as eventually injurious to believe that other people “should” adopt and live by one’s own
  personal standards, morals, and code of conduct as well as interpretation of reality. Projected moralism is always

  war (such as the naïve American view that all other nations “should” be democracies). One can, by choice, reject the
  temptation to habitual judgmentalism. The result is a great inner peace.

  The limitations of love have to do with perceived qualities and differences. Through inner self- honesty and
  examination, these areas of limitation are revealed, usually as residual judgments or as the impact from prior
  experience. A key to making love unconditional is the willingness of forgiveness to undo past reservations or
  experiences, or viewing people as unlovable.

  As spiritual awareness advances, the flow of spiritual energy increases and enables transcending prior, seemingly
  insurmountable obstacles. As the attractions of the world and emotions decrease, there is a progressive attraction to
  qualities such as beauty, lovability, and peace, rather than “things” or seeming gains. Forgiveness becomes a habitual
  attitude, and the innate innocence of all creation shines forth. The teachings of great saints and teachers become
  one’s own from within.

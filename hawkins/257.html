  Safeguards against being programmed by society are: (1) emotional detachment, in which all information is viewed as
  provisional; (2) awareness that ordinary mentalization is unable to discern perception from essence; and (3) knowing
  that the wolf often hides beneath sheep’s clothing. This suspension of belief is the practical application of the
  basic dictum to “wear the world like a loose garment.” To “be in the world but not of it” is a mode of attention that
  nevertheless still allows spontaneous interaction and function in society.

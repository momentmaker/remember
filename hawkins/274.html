  Meaning is defined by context, which determines motive, and it is the motive that establishes spiritual value. To
  dedicate one’s actions as a service of love to life is to sanctify them and transform them from self-seeking motives
  to unselfish gifts. We define excellence as dedication to the highest standards. Every act can then be held as an
  opportunity to glorify God by sheer purity of endeavor. All physical tasks and labor can be ingredients in one’s
  contribution to the world. Even the smallest task can be seen as serving the common good and, if viewed in that light,
  work becomes ennobled.

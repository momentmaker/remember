  Peace can be the consequence of surrender to the inevitabilities of life. The religious/spiritual skeptic can look
  within and observe that the inner fundamental irreducible quality of life is the capacity of awareness, consciousness,
  and the substrate of subjectivity.<br>
  <br>
  Without consciousness, we would not “know” or even “know if we know,” so that consciousness is the determinable
  awareness of existence, irrespective of the content of that existence. Thus, consciousness itself can be accepted as
  an obvious reality, without the elaboration of being Divine (as recommended by the Buddha). To “be” is one thing; to
  know that one “is” obviously requires a more transcendent quality.

  If the goal of life is to do the very best one can do at each unfolding moment of existence, then, through spiritual
  work, one has already escaped the primary cause of suffering. In the stopframe of the radical present, there is no
  life story to react to or edit. With this “one-pointedness” of mind, it soon becomes obvious that everything merely
  “is as it is,” without comment or adjectives.

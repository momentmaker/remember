  By being loving toward others, we discover that we are surrounded by love and lovingness. When we unreservedly support
  life without expecting gain, life supports us in return. Whenever we abandon gain as a motive, life responds with
  unexpected generosity. And when we perceive in this way, the miraculous begins to appear in the life of every
  dedicated spiritual aspirant.

  It is helpful to remember that neither truth nor enlightenment is something to be found, sought, acquired, gained, or
  possessed. The Infinite Presence is always present, and its realization occurs of itself when the obstacles to that
  realization are removed. It is, therefore, not necessary to study the truth, but only to let go of that which is
  fallacious. Moving away the clouds does not cause the sun to shine, but merely reveals what was hidden all along.<br>
  <br>
  Spiritual work, in other words, is primarily a letting go of the presumably known for the unknown, with the promise by
  others who have done it that the effort is more than well rewarded at the end.

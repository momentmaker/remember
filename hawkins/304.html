  Cessation of fear is the result of learning that the source of happiness is within. It stems from recognizing that
  this source is the joy of one’s own existence, which is continuous and not dependent on externals. This results from
  surrendering expectations and demands on one’s self, the world, and others. The thought I can only be happy if I win
  or get what I want is a guarantee of worry, anxiety, and unhappiness.

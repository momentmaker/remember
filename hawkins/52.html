  It is helpful to remember that value and attraction are in the eye of the beholder and are not qualities of the world
  itself. What is imagined to be “out there” stems from “in here.” The same applies to cherished positionalities and
  seductive presumptions. There are no temptations “out there,” and their attraction diminishes by simple refusal and
  renunciation.

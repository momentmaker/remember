  Q: The attractions of the world seem endless. Is it really safe to go there? I often just want to escape.<br>
  <br>
  A: The attractions are not innate to the world, but reflect projected values and the expectation of the payoffs of ego
  satisfactions. In actuality, joy stems from within and is not dependent on externals. Pleasure is associated with what
  is valued and esteemed. Much of projected value arises from imagination, and values reflect desires. In reality,
  nothing is more valuable than anything else other than spiritual fulfillment.

  A useful approach is to let the love for God replace the willfulness that is driving the seeking. One can release all
  desire to seek, and realize that the thought that there is anything else but God is a baseless vanity. This is the
  same vanity that claims authorship for one’s experiences, thoughts, and actions. With reflection, it can be seen that
  both the body and the mind are the result of the innumerable conditions of the universe, and that one is at best the
  witness of this concordance.<br>

  Out of an unrestricted love for God arises the willingness to surrender all motives except to serve God completely. To
  be the servant of God becomes one’s goal rather than enlightenment. To be a perfect channel for God’s love is to
  surrender completely and to eliminate the goal seeking of the spiritual ego. Joy itself becomes the initiator of
  further spiritual work.

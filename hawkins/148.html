  A self-honest person is not prone to having his or her feelings hurt or “having a bone to pick” with others. Honest
  insight has an immediate benefit in the reduction of actual as well as potential emotional pain. A person is
  vulnerable to emotional pain in exact relationship to the degree of self- awareness and self-acceptance.

  All the mindâ€™s statements are provisional at best, and an awareness of that limitation is an intrinsic quality of
  wisdom. Wisdom denotes a degree of humility as well as flexibility. It also implies a conservative, cautious attitude
  that is aware that further information will accrue over time and experience. Thus, wisdom considers all knowledge to
  be provisional and subject to change, not only in meaning but also in significance and value.

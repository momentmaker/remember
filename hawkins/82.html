<div id="h82">
  We witness, observe, and record apparent processions of experience. But even in awareness itself, nothing actually
  happens. Awareness merely registers what is being experienced; it has no effect on it. Awareness is the
  all-encompassing attractor field of unlimited power identical with life itself. And there is nothing the mind believes
  that is not erroneous at a higher level of awareness.

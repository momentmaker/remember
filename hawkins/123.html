  An analysis of the nature of consciousness reveals that redemption occurs as the result of the return of consciousness
  to its original pristine state of nonduality. It can do so only by the “obedience” of surrendering the dualities of
  will and willfulness of the ego to the nonduality of God’s Truth. The return from the duality of the ego to the
  nonduality of the spirit is so difficult and unlikely that only by Divine Grace is it even possible. Thus, man needs a
  savior to be his advocate, his inspiration, and the fulcrum of his salvation from the pain and suffering of the ego.

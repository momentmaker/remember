  Acceptance is the great healer of strife, conflict, and upset. It also corrects major imbalances of perception and
  precludes the dominance of negative feelings. Everything serves a purpose. Humility means that we will not understand
  all events or occurrences. Acceptance is not passivity, but non- positionality.

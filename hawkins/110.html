  What is searching for higher truth is not a personal “I” but an aspect of consciousness itself, which expresses as
  inspiration, devotion, dedication, and perseverance—all of which are aspects of the spiritual will. Therefore, the
  source of the search for the Self is the Self itself actualizing the necessary processes by virtue of its own
  qualities, which are facilitated by Grace.

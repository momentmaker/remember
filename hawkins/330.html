<div id="h330">
  We honor that which we esteem in others as well as ourselves. Out of this, one honors oneâ€™s own humanity and that of
  others and ends up honoring all of life in all its expressions by resignation to Divine Will. With surrender of the
  ego, the spirit becomes aware of the sanctity of existence.

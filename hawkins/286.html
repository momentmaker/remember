  The essential fundamental principles for spiritual endeavor are the time-honored ones, such as devotion, humility,
  fortitude, willingness to surrender, and faith and trust in God. These are reinforced by dedication, prayer, and the
  supplication and invocation of Godâ€™s Grace by an act of the spiritual will. . . . These are empowered by intention,
  which results in alignment and integration whereby the basic principles become operative. Devotion is a consequence of
  assent by the will. Complete and total surrender to God can eclipse the process at any given point along the way.

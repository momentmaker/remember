<div id="h2">
  The world of the ego is like a house of mirrors through which the ego wanders, lost and confused, as it chases the
  images in one mirror after another. Human life is characterized by endless trials and errors to escape the maze. At
  times, for many people (and possibly for most), the world of mirrors becomes a house of horrors that gets worse and
  worse. The only way out of the circuitous wanderings is through the pursuit of spiritual truth.

<div id="h350">
  Trust in the love, mercy, infinite wisdom, and compassion of Divinity, which sees through all human error, limitation,
  and frailty. Place faith and trust in the love of God, which is allforgiving, and understand that condemnation and
  fear of judgment stem from the ego. Like the sun, the love of God shines equally on all. Avoid negative depictions
  (jealous, angry, destructive, partial, favoring, vengeful, insecure, vulnerable, contractual, and so forth) of God as
  an anthropomorphic projection.

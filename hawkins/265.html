  If one looks at the feeling of happiness, it becomes clear that it is in fact located within. Although the trigger may
  appear to come from outside oneself, the sensation is totally an inner feeling of pleasure. The source of happiness is
  within, and it is released under favorable circumstances when the mind experiences a desired outcome. Through inner
  examination, one will discover that the event merely triggers an innate capacity. With the discovery that the source
  of happiness is actually within oneâ€™s inner self and therefore cannot be lost, there is a reduction of fear.

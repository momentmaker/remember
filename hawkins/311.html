  Complete surrender to God unveils the truth; nothing is hidden. Only the ego is blind, and Reality lies just beyond
  the mind. Out of the fear of becoming nothing, consciousness denies its only reality that it is everythingâ€”the
  infinite, everlasting Allness out of which existence itself arises.

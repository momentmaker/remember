  If the desire arises to surrender all obstacles to love and to God, then God is already present in the form of
  willingness. When one reaches devotion, there is already quite an advanced presence that is dissolving the ego and
  illuminating the way. Spiritual progress and discovery are accompanied by joy, which is the radiance of the Self, and
  quickly replaces the surrendered egoâ€™s positionalities. Spiritual inspiration increases in intensity each step along
  the way. When the self stops looking to the world or to the ego, it discovers that its source has been the Self all
  along.

  The dualistic mind sees what appears to be an event, a happening, or a thing and hypothesizes another concept, that of
  “change.” The mind seeks explanations and is naïve as to its own structure, motivations, and limitations. In language,
  it is said that the “I” or an “it” caused a “that,” much like that which is intrinsic to sentence structure in which a
  subject acts on an object via a verb. The self then presumes that there is an inner primary causal agent, such as the
  “doer” of deeds, the “thinker” of thoughts, and the “deciders” of decisions. Without such a dualistic explanation, the
  linear mind is at a loss to explain the appearance of phenomena.

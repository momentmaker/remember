<div id="h180">
  One “owes” contrition and confession only to the Self. One “owes” the undoing of “sin and guilt” to the Self. One
  “owes” the obligation to change one’s ways to the Self. One “owes” it to the Self to give up positionalities.
  Suffering only serves the ego. Of what use would it be to God, Who has no needs or emotion, and Who would in no way be
  pleasured by human agony?

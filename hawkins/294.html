<div id="h294">
  Relief of guilt and greater compassion for oneself and others occurs through realizing that the individual person did
  not volitionally create the structure of the ego, nor did anybody else. The human condition is primarily a karmic
  “given”—it can be accepted compassionately as such without condemnation, and is therefore neither good nor bad.
  Mankind lives in the realm of tension between emotional instincts and the counterbalancing power of spiritual
  awakening (that is, the animal/angel conflict).

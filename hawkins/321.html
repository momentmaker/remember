  To endeavor to evolve spiritually is the greatest gift one can give. It actually uplifts all mankind from within
  because of the nature of power itself. Power radiates and is shared; whereas force is limited, self-defeating, and
  evanescent. All society is subliminally and subtly influenced by every kind and loving thought, word, or deed. Every
  forgiveness is a benefit to everyone. The universe notes and records every action and returns it in kind. Karma is
  actually the very nature of the universe because of the innate structure and function of the universe itself. In the
  universe, time is measured in eons. Beyond that, it doesnâ€™t even exist at all. Every kindness is therefore forever.

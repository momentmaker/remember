  Traditionally, the pathways to God have been through the heart (love, devotion, selfless service, surrender, worship,
  and adoration) or through the mind (Advaita, or the pathway of nonduality). Each way may seem more comfortable at one
  stage or another, or they alternate in emphasis.<br>
  <br>
  Whether you take the pathway of the heart or the mind, it is a hindrance to consider that there is a personal self or
  an “I” or an ego that is doing the striving or seeking or which will become enlightened. It is much easier to realize
  there is no such thing as the ego or an “I” identity that is doing any seeking; instead, it is an impersonal aspect of
  consciousness that is doing the exploring and seeking.

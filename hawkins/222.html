  Humor is important to the maturation process, whereby we learn how to not take ourselves so seriously and to laugh at
  ourselves, thus decreasing narcissistic defensiveness. To be prone to “hurt feelings” is egocentric and a form of
  social paranoia. When we admit our downside and learn to laugh at it, we are no longer vulnerable to slights and
  insults.

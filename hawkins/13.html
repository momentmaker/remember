  All avenues of questioning lead to the same ultimate answer. The discovery that nothing is hidden and truth stands
  everywhere revealed is the key to enlightenment about the simplest practical affairs and the destiny of mankind. In

  displacement of the false by the true is the essence of the healing of all things visible and invisible.

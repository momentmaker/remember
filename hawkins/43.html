  Spiritual evolution is the automatic consequence of watching the mind—and its proclivities as an “it”—from the general
  viewpoint of the paradigm of context rather than content. Instead of trying to force change, it is merely necessary to
  allow Divinity to do so by deeply surrendering all control, resistance, and illusions of gain or loss. It is not
  necessary to destroy or attack illusions but merely to allow them to fall away.

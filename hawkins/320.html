<div id="h320">
  Everyone is exposed to life in its expression as nature, as well as in that human interaction called society. Such
  interaction is impersonal, and the vicissitudes of life are inevitable and unavoidable—this can be either challenging
  or depressing, depending solely on one’s point of view. Without positionalities, life is experienced as serene and
  interesting. This point of view fosters growth and (hopefully) wisdom, rather than selfpity or bitterness. Everyone is
  free to make a choice. The rain does not determine whether one will be happy or disappointed. The surrender of
  willfulness/positionality brings peace in all circumstances.

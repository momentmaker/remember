  Q: How can one prevent the development of a spiritual ego? Each success seems like it would feed it.<br>
  <br>
  A: Realize that there is no such entity as the doer of deeds or actions. There is no doer/self to take blame or
  credit. Progress is the result of a quality of consciousness that has been activated by the assent of the spiritual
  will. Spiritual inspiration becomes the energy that is operating; it doesnâ€™t emanate from the ego/self.

<div id="h3">
  All life ebbs and flows. Everyone is born, suffers afflictions, and dies. There is happiness and sadness, catastrophe
  and success, increase and decrease. The stock market rises and falls. Diseases and accidents come and go. The karmic
  dance of life unfolds in the karmic theater of the universe.

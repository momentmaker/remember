  Q: What prayers are useful?<br>
  <br>
  A: Ask to be the servant of the Lord, a vehicle of Divine love, a channel of God’s will. Ask for direction and Divine
  assistance, and surrender all personal will through devotion. Dedicate one’s life to the service of God. Choose love
  and peace above all other options. Commit to the goal of unconditional love and compassion for all life, in all its
  expressions, and surrender all judgment to God.

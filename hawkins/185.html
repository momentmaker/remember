  Dedication is a more important sign of integrity than enthusiasm. It is necessary to have faith in a pathway and clear
  away doubts to ascertain if they are realistic or merely forms of resistance. A seeker should have the security and
  support of inner certainty and firm conviction that are consequent to study, personal research, and investigation.
  Thus, a pathway should be intrinsically reconfirming by discovery and inner experience. A true pathway unfolds, is
  self-revelatory, and is subject to reconfirmation experientially.

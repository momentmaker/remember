  Spiritual commitment is energized by the alignment of the spiritual will with the attributes of Divinity, which are
  truth, love, compassion, wisdom, and nonpartiality. Devotion prioritizes oneâ€™s life and attracts that which is of
  assistance. To be a servant of God is a dedication whereby the goal takes precedence over all other positionalities,
  attractions, or distractions.

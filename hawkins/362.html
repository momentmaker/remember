  All reactions to life are subjective. There is nothing happening that is awful, exciting, sad, good, or bad. It is
  pointless to hold a position that catastrophes shouldn’t “happen” or that the innocent didn’t deserve it, or isn’t it
  awful, or it must be somebody’s fault. With a broad view, one can remain unperturbed by either the content or the
  context of life. That requires giving up judgments, expectations, or sensitivities.

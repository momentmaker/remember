  The benefit of accepting oneâ€™s defects instead of denying them is an increase in an inner sense of self-honesty,
  security, and higher self-esteem, accompanied by greatly diminished defensiveness. A self-honest person is not prone
  to having his or her feelings hurt by others; therefore, honest insight has an immediate benefit in the reduction of
  actual, as well as potential, emotional pain.

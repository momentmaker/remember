  Accept that all sentient beings live by faith. Despite naïve and pretentious claims to the contrary, all people live
  solely by the principle of faith—it is only a question of faith in what. Faith can be placed in the illusory, the
  intellect, reason, science, progress, political and worldly power, ego satisfactions, pleasure, wealth, or hope (such
  as “tomorrow”).

<div id="h342">
  Value, from the ego’s viewpoint, is an emotionalized mentalization, and Reality does not require mentalization. With
  humility, one can honestly state and witness that everything merely “is as it is,” independent of projected worth. Its
  intrinsic “value” is that it “is”; that is, existence is complete within itself and is not needful of projected
  nominalization as “special.” When the Divine Essence of All of Creation shines forth without obstruction, then the
  ego/ mind goes silent in awe.

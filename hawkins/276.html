<div id="h276">
  How life is contextualized can bring either joy or resentment; stinginess can be replaced by generosity. If others
  benefit from oneâ€™s efforts, so much the better. Everyone has the opportunity to contribute to harmony and beauty by
  kindness to others and thereby support the human spirit. That which is freely given to life flows back to us because
  we are equally part of that life. Like ripples on the water, every gift returns to the giver. What we affirm in
  others, we actually affirm in ourselves.

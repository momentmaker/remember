  As the payoffs of the ego are refused and surrendered, its grip on the psyche lessens, and spiritual experience
  progresses as the residuals of doubt are progressively relinquished. As a consequence, belief is replaced by
  experiential knowledge; the depth and intensity of devotion increases and may eventually supersede and eclipse all
  other worldly activities and interests.

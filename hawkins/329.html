  When the mind stops talking, one is aware that one is life. One is immersed in it rather than being on the surface,
  talking about it. Paradoxically, this enables full participation. When egocentricity diminishes, the joy of freedom
  and the sheer flow of life sweep one into total surrender. One then stops reacting to life, so it can be enjoyed with
  serenity.

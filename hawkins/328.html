  There is no timetable or prescribed path to God. Although each person’s route is unique, the terrain to be covered is
  relatively common to all. The work is to surmount and transcend the common human failings that are inherent in the
  structure of the human ego. One would like to think that one is personal, yet the ego itself is not personal—it was
  inherited along with becoming a human being. Details differ based on past karma.

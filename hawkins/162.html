  Detachment from positionalities—and especially the positionalities occasioned by labeling— leads to serenity, freedom,
  and security. Greater serenity arises from relating to the context of life rather than to the content, which is
  primarily a game board of interacting egos. This broader style of relating to life leads to greater compassion and
  emancipation from being at the effect of the world.

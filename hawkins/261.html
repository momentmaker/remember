  Our experience of the world and life is totally the result of inner beliefs and positionalities. Out of love and
  respect for God arises the willingness to surrender all these prejudgments, and the humility that ensues opens the
  doors to the splendor of reality, which is the revelation of the Self. Love is the magic catalyst that brings about
  the awareness. In the end, faith is replaced by certainty, and therefore it is said that God is found by those who
  seek Him.

  Whereas the goal of the ego/mind is primarily to do, act, acquire, or perform, the intention of contemplation is to
  “become.” While the intellect wants to know “about,” contemplation seeks knowingness itself and autonomous wisdom.
  Rational thinking is time related, sequential, and linear. Contemplation, in contrast, occurs outside of sequential
  time—it is nonlinear and related to comprehension of essence. Devotional contemplation is a way or style of being in
  the world whereby one’s life becomes a prayer.

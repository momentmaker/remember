  Q: What should be the overall context of spiritual endeavor?<br>
  <br>
  A: Selfless service out of love for all creatures and creation. To pursue enlightenment serves God and fellow humans.
  Be alert and attuned to the innate beauty of all that exists. See the charm and quaintness of even what the world
  would consider old, beat-up, and ugly.

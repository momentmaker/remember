  In Reality, there are no events; there are no beginnings or endings. The backdrop is silent, still, and undisturbed by
  the movie. One’s reality is the context and not the content. The oneness of life appears to perception as
  multitudinous. What makes the appearances of the world seem real is a projection of the radiance of the Self. The
  movie itself has no intrinsic reality as perceived. The actual locus of the sense of realness lies totally within
  consciousness as subjectivity. Even if there were such a thing as an independent, objective reality, it would only be
  knowable because of one’s internal subjectivity.

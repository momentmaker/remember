  Courage arises from commitment and integrity of alignment and dedication. A valuable characteristic of dedication is
  felicity, which eventually becomes empowered as a quiet but persistent inner fervor. The value of watchful witnessing
  is that even just awareness of an ego defect tends to undo it. By surrender and prayerful invocation, Divine Will
  facilitates transition from the lesser to the greater, for the Self effortlessly supports and energizes intention.<br>
  <br>
  The Self is like a magnetic attraction by which the personal will is progressively surrendered and resistance is
  weakened. Thus, the pathway itself is self-fulfilling and gratifying, and reveals progressive rewards. Each step, no
  matter how seemingly small, is equally valuable.

<div id="h287">
  To align one’s life with spiritual intention expands its meaning and significance. While the ego/body/mind’s life span
  is limited and temporary, the life of the spirit is eternal, and its importance thus eclipses transitory gains of ego
  satisfaction. The lesser is then surrendered to the greater by alignment, commitment, and agreement—because it is
  freely chosen rather than imposed, there is a lessening of resistance.

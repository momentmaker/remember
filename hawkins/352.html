  To consciously choose alignment with Divinity and truth is reempowering and shifts identity from the self to the Self,
  resulting in an increase in confidence, courage, and personal dignity rather than self-abasement or self-denigration.
  Total surrender brings peace; partial or conditional surrender bring lingering doubt.

<div id="h296">
  In the reality of nonduality, there is neither privilege nor gain nor loss nor rank. Just like a cork in the sea, each
  spirit rises or falls to its own level in the sea of consciousness by virtue of its own choices, not by any external
  force or favor. Some are attracted by the light and some seek the darkness, but it all occurs of its own nature by
  virtue of Divine freedom and equality.

  Humor is a means of detachment or recontextualizing the events of life. It is a way of being lighthearted and “wearing
  the world like a loose garment.” It leads to compassion for the totality of human life and reveals the option that one
  can play at life without getting involved in it as though it were an exhausting life-and-death struggle.

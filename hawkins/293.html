  All forms of loss are a confrontation to the ego and its survival mechanisms. All aspects of human life are transient,
  so to cling to any aspect eventually brings grief and loss. Each incident, however, is an opportunity to search within
  for the source of life, which is ever present, unchanging, and not subject to loss or the ravages of time.

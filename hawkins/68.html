  Holding a goal in mind is inspirational and actually helpful to its accomplishment, because what is held in mind tends
  to actualize. However, it is a mistake to attack oneself with guilt for failing to achieve the ideal. Upon
  examination, it will be frequently discovered that it was not really the goal that was desired, but the satisfaction
  that was associated with it.

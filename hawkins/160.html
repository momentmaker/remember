<div id="h160">
  Simple kindness to one’s self and all that lives is the most powerful transformational force of all. It produces no
  backlash, has no downside, and never leads to loss or despair. It increases one’s own true power without exacting any
  toll. But to reach maximum power, such kindness can permit no exceptions, nor can it be practiced with the expectation
  of some selfish reward. And its effect is as far-reaching as it is subtle.

  To undo shame, it is helpful to realize that it is based on pride. The loss of status is painful to the degree that
  the ego relies on pride as a prop to self-esteem. Were it not for narcissistic pride, a mistake or negative feedback
  would be experienced only as a regret and ascribed to human frailty and fallibility. Mistakes help one retain
  humility.

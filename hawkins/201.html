  Courage does not mean absence of fear, but the willingness to surmount itâ€”which, when accomplished, reveals hidden
  strength and the capacity for fortitude. Fear of failure is diminished by realizing that one is responsible for the
  intention and effort but not the result, which is dependent on many other conditions and factors that are nonpersonal.

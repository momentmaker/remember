  Actions are the automatic consequence of the integration of context, field, and intention. All action is actually
  spontaneous and reflects karmic propensities and local conditions that may or may not favor expression. To
  depersonalize actions, it is only necessary to let go of the belief that there is a separate, independent causal agent
  called “I” or “me.”

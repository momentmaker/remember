  Most humans believe that love is something you get, that it is an emotion, that it has to be deserved, and that the
  more they give away, the less they will have. The opposite is the truth. Lovingness is an attitude that transforms
  oneâ€™s experience of the world. We become grateful for what we have instead of being prideful. We express our
  lovingness when we acknowledge others and their contributions to life and to our conveniences. Love is not an emotion,
  but a way of being and relating to the world.

<div id="h142">
  That which has existence is already total and complete or it would not exist. Existence does not require dependence on
  some other condition. Conditional existence is therefore an illusion of the ego/mind, which believes that nothing
  exists except as dependent on something outside itself. Existence is self-complete and unconditional. Existence is
  solely by the grace of God, by Divine ordinance.

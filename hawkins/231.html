  The antidote to pride is to choose humility and integrity instead of a positionality such as being important or right,
  getting even, indulging in blame, or seeking admiration. All credit for accomplishment is given to God as the presence
  of the Divinity within instead of to the ego; therefore, accomplishment results in gratitude and joy rather than
  vulnerable pridefulness.

  Fears are eliminated by graceful acceptance of the qualities inherent in the human condition, which brings to
  awareness the comforting realization that oneâ€™s discomforts are shared equally by all. This results in a healing
  compassion toward all life. To become loving brings an end to the fear of loss of love, for lovingness engenders love
  wherever it goes.

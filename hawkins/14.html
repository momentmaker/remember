  Classically, the readiness for serious spiritual work is referred to as “ripeness,” at which point even hearing a
  single word, phrase, or name may trigger a sudden decision and commitment to truth. The advent of spiritual dedication
  may thus be subtle, slow, and gradual, and then take a very sudden and major jump. By whatever route, once the seed
  falls on ready ground, the journey begins in earnest. Commonly, the turning point can be triggered by an unexpected
  flash of insight, and from that moment on, life changes.

  Like a cork in water or a balloon in the atmosphere, each spirit rises to its own level of buoyancy within the
  infinite realms of energy fields of consciousness. No external “judgment” or Divine coercion is involved. Each being
  radiates forth its essence and so determines its own destiny. Thus is Divine justice perfect. By choice, each spirit
  becomes what it has chosen. Within all realms, there exists the moment-to-moment choice of the absolute reality that
  is ever present and whose absolute choice results in liberation.

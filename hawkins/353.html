<div id="h353">
  Surrender of the personal will to the will (wisdom) of God (or Providence or Higher Power) signifies relinquishment of
  control. One can expect the ego to resist doing so, and it invents excuses, counterarguments, and multiple fears in
  order to maintain illusory control. The egoâ€™s positions are reinforced by pride as well as desire for specific
  results. Thus, to the ego, to step back and invite the intervention of Divinity seems like a loss; whereas, to the
  spirit, it is definitely a win.

  The realization that there is a source of joy and happiness that is beyond the ego is a major step. Then curiosity and
  an interest in how to reach spiritual goals arises. Belief also arises, which is then bolstered by faith, and
  eventually by experience. Next follows the acquisition of instruction, information, and the practice of what has been
  learned. By invitation, the spiritual energy increases, followed by dedication and the willingness to surrender all
  obstacles.<br>

  Even the decision to turn oneâ€™s life over to God brings joy and gives life a whole new meaning. It becomes uplifting,
  and the greater context gives life more significance and reward. One eventually becomes unwilling to support
  negativity, within or without. This is not because it is wrong, but merely futile. Although the journey to God begins
  with failure and doubt, it progresses into certainty. The way is really quite simple.

  The major limitation of consciousness is its innocence. Consciousness is gullible; it believes everything it hears.
  Consciousness is like hardware that will play back any software that’s put into it. We never lose the innocence of our
  own consciousness; it persists, naïve and trusting, like an impressionable child. Its only guardian is a discerning
  awareness that scrutinizes the incoming program.

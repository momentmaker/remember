  Underlying all fears is the primordial, instinctual fear of death itself; therefore, much inner work can be bypassed
  by de-energizing this fear as early as possible in oneâ€™s spiritual work. The fear of physical death arises from the
  animal instinct plus the narcissism of the ego, which is in love with itself. Death implies an end of experiencing,
  and experiencing is equated with life; thus, the ego clings to that which is linear and familiar.

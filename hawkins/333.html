  Experientially, guilt is an operational “reality” until the underpinnings of the ego are removed. Spiritual seekers
  are sometimes prone to look back critically on their past actions from their newfound spiritual position. All
  self-examination should be done with compassion, keeping in mind that past errors arose within a different context.
  The best resolution of guilt is to rededicate oneself to God and one’s fellow man, and to the forgiveness of self and
  others.

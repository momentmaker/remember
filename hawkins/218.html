  The most important quality necessary for true growth and evolution is the practice and principle of humility. It is
  far less painful to voluntarily adopt a fundamental attitude of humility than to have it thrust upon oneself as the
  painful consequence of ineptitude. Despite its negative public and social image in some quarters of society, humility
  is indicative of expertise, wisdom, and maturity. Because truth is the very bedrock and ultimate reality upon which
  humility is based, it is not a vulnerability in and of itself. Rather, humility reveals that the mind can only “know
  about,” and that it cannot differentiate between appearance and essence.

  The source of joy of spiritual endeavor stems from the work itself and is not dependent on outcomes or the achievement
  of goals. Each movement forward has an inner delight. There is, for instance, an inner pleasure that accompanies
  progress. The replacement of resentment with peaceful acceptance is its own reward. There is a progressive alteration
  in one’s view of self and others. When this happens, one’s own life story can then be reinterpreted from a more
  compassionate understanding.

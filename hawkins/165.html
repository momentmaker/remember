  Personal judgment is based on perception that is reinforced by belief and prior programming, all of which are held in
  place by the payoff of the negative energies of the ego. The ego just “loves” suffering a “wrong,” being the martyr,
  being misunderstood, and being the endless victim of life’s vicissitudes. Consequently, it gets an enormous payoff—not
  only from the positionality itself but also from sympathy, self-pity, entitlements, importance, or being “center
  stage” in which the self is the hero or heroine of the melodrama.

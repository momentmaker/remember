  Q: What is a workable goal?<br>
  <br>
  A: To verify spiritual truth experientially and to become it rather than just conform to it. The process is an
  unfolding of discovery resulting in greater happiness and diminution of fear, guilt, and other negative emotions. The
  motive is inner development, evolution, and fulfillment of potential, which is independent of the external world. Life
  becomes progressive rather than just repetitive. All experience is of equal value and innately pleasurable so that
  life stops being an endless sequence of alternating pleasure and displeasure. With inner progress, context expands,
  resulting in greater awareness of significance and meaningâ€”and, therefore, gratification of potential.

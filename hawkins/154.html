  Judgmentalism is the great vanity of all egos. Scripture says, “Judge not, lest ye be judged.” Also, “Judgment is
  mine, sayeth the Lord.” Christ said to forgive. The Buddha said that there is nothing to judge because perception can
  only see illusion. Perception is always partial and limited by an arbitrary context. In truth, no judgment is
  possible.

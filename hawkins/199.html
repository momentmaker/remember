<div id="h199">
  Supplication and prayer to Divinity are facilitated by a profound and deep surrender to humility. This humility is
  merely the truthful acknowledgment of the actual fact that the ego/mind, by virtue of its structure and design, is
  intrinsically incapable of being able to differentiate truth from falsehood (that is, essence from appearance).

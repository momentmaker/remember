  The spiritual information necessary for advanced states should be learned early and stored away for when it is needed.
  The possible downside of hearing advanced information early is the intellect’s presumption of the prideful I know
  that. It is better to hold the information as I have heard that. To truly “know” is to “be,” at which point one does
  not know; instead, one is.

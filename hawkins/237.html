<div id="h237">
  A source of regret and loss is the unrealistic expectations of the self and others. Nothing in the world of form is
  permanent. Eventually, all has to be surrendered to the will of God. To succeed at surrendering, it is necessary to
  realize that God’s will is not personalized to suit individual wishes. The will of God is really the karmic design of
  the entire universe. To surrender to God’s will is to surrender to the truth that nothing other than the Ultimate
  Reality is permanent. All that arises in form passes away. A loss is an opportunity to become freed from an
  attachment.

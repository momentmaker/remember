<div id="h105">
  There is no inner “thinker” behind thoughts, no “doer” behind actions, no “seeker” of enlightenment. Seeking occurs on
  its own when the time is right, and it emerges as a focus of attention. All aspects and qualities of consciousness are
  self-actuating and energize each other under the general direction of the will.

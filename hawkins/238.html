<div id="h238">
  The spiritually evolved person who has few wants or attachments is relatively immune to grief, as the experience of
  the source of happiness originates from within and is not dependent on externals. If the source of happiness is
  acquired through ego mechanisms, it is based on imagery, belief systems, and projected values rather than on Absolute
  Reality itself, which is invulnerable to loss. Objects, qualities, or relationships become overvalued by virtue of the
  mechanism of attachment and the ensuing projection of value.

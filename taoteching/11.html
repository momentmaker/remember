<div id="c11">
  We join spokes together in a wheel,<br>
  but it is the center hole<br>
  that makes the wagon move.<br>
  <br>
  We shape clay into a pot,<br>
  but it is the emptiness inside<br>
  that holds whatever we want.<br>
  <br>
  We hammer wood for a house,<br>
  but it is the inner space<br>
  that makes it livable.<br>
  <br>
  We work with being,<br>
  but non-being is what we use.<br>

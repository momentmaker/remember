<div id="t77">
  As it acts in the world, the Tao<br>
  is like the bending of a bow.<br>
  The top is bent downward;<br>
  the bottom is bent up.<br>
  It adjusts excess and deficiency<br>
  so that there is perfect balance.<br>
  It takes from what is too much<br>
  and give to what isn't enough.<br>
  <br>
  Those who try to control,<br>
  who use force to protect their power,<br>
  go against the direction of the Tao.<br>
  They take from those who don't have enough<br>
  and give to those who have far too much.<br>
  <br>
  The Master can keep giving<br>
  because there is no end to her wealth.<br>
  She acts without expectation,<br>
  succeeds without taking credit,<br>
  and doesn't think that she is better<br>
  than anyone else.<br>

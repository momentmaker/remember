<div id="c33">
  Knowing others is intelligence;<br>
  knowing yourself is true wisdom.<br>
  Mastering others is strength;<br>
  mastering yourself is true power.<br>
  <br>
  If you realize that you have enough,<br>
  you are truly rich.<br>
  If you stay in the center<br>
  and embrace death with your whole heart,<br>
  you will endure forever.<br>

<div id="t36">
  If you want to shrink something,<br>
  you must first allow it to expand.<br>
  If you want to get rid of something,<br>
  you must first allow it to flourish.<br>
  If you want to take something,<br>
  you must first allow it to be given.<br>
  This is called the subtle perception<br>
  of the way things are.<br>
  <br>
  The soft overcomes the hard.<br>
  The slow overcomes the fast.<br>
  Let your workings remain a mystery.<br>
  Just show people the results.<br>

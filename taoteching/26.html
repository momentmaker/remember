<div id="t26">
  The heavy is the root of the light.<br>
  The unmoved is the source of all movement.<br>
  <br>
  Thus the Master travels all day<br>
  without leaving home.<br>
  However splendid the views,<br>
  she stays serenely in herself.<br>
  <br>
  Why should the lord of the country<br>
  flit about like a fool?<br>
  If you let yourself be blown to and fro,<br>
  you lose touch with your root.<br>
  If you let restlessness move you,<br>
  you lose touch with who you are.<br>

<div id="c67">
  Some say that my teaching is nonsense.<br>
  Others call it lofty but impractical.<br>
  But to those who have looked inside themselves,<br>
  this nonsense makes perfect sense.<br>
  And to those who put it into practice,<br>
  this loftiness has roots that go deep.<br>
  <br>
  I have just three things to teach:<br>
  simplicity, patience, compassion.<br>
  These three are your greatest treasures.<br>
  Simple in actions and in thoughts,<br>
  you return to the source of being.<br>
  Patient with both friends and enemies,<br>
  you accord with the way things are.<br>
  Compassionate toward yourself,<br>
  you reconcile all beings in the world.<br>

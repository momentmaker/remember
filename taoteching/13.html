<div id="c13">
  Success is as dangerous as failure.<br>
  Hope is as hollow as fear.<br>
  <br>
  What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?<br>
  Whether you go up the ladder or down it,<br>
  you position is shaky.<br>
  When you stand with your two feet on the ground,<br>
  you will always keep your balance.<br>
  <br>
  What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?<br>
  Hope and fear are both phantoms<br>
  that arise from thinking of the self.<br>
  When we don't see the self as self,<br>
  what do we have to fear?<br>
  <br>
  See the world as your self.<br>
  Have faith in the way things are.<br>
  Love the world as your self;<br>
  then you can care for all things.<br>

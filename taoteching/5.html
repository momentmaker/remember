<div id="c5">
  The Tao doesn't take sides;<br>
  it gives birth to both good and evil.<br>
  The Master doesn't take sides;<br>
  she welcomes both saints and sinners.<br>
  <br>
  The Tao is like a bellows:<br>
  it is empty yet infinitely capable.<br>
  The more you use it, the more it produces;<br>
  the more you talk of it, the less you understand.<br>
  <br>
  Hold on to the center.<br>

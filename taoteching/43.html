<div id="c43">
  The gentlest thing in the world<br>
  overcomes the hardest thing in the world.<br>
  That which has no substance<br>
  enters where there is no space.<br>
  This shows the value of non-action.<br>
  <br>
  Teaching without words,<br>
  performing without actions:<br>
  that is the Master's way.<br>

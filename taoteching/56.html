<div id="c56">
  Those who know don't talk.<br>
  Those who talk don't know.<br>
  <br>
  Close your mouth,<br>
  block off your senses,<br>
  blunt your sharpness,<br>
  untie your knots,<br>
  soften your glare,<br>
  settle your dust.<br>
  This is the primal identity.<br>
  <br>
  Be like the Tao.<br>
  It can't be approached or withdrawn from,<br>
  benefited or harmed,<br>
  honored or brought into disgrace.<br>
  It gives itself up continually.<br>
  That is why it endures.<br>

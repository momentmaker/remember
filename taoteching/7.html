<div id="c7">
  The Tao is infinite, eternal.<br>
  Why is it eternal?<br>
  It was never born;<br>
  thus it can never die.<br>
  Why is it infinite?<br>
  It has no desires for itself;<br>
  thus it is present for all beings.<br>
  <br>
  The Master stays behind;<br>
  that is why she is ahead.<br>
  She is detached from all things;<br>
  that is why she is one with them.<br>
  Because she has let go of herself,<br>
  she is perfectly fulfilled.<br>

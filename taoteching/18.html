<div id="t18">
  When the great Tao is forgotten,<br>
  goodness and piety appear.<br>
  When the body's intelligence declines,<br>
  cleverness and knowledge step forth.<br>
  When there is no peace in the family,<br>
  filial piety begins.<br>
  When the country falls into chaos,<br>
  patriotism is born.<br>
</div>

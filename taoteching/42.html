<div id="t42">
  The Tao gives birth to One.<br>
  One gives birth to Two.<br>
  Two gives birth to Three.<br>
  Three gives birth to all things.<br>
  <br>
  All things have their backs to the female<br>
  and stand facing the male.<br>
  When male and female combine,<br>
  all things achieve harmony.<br>
  <br>
  Ordinary men hate solitude.<br>
  But the Master makes use of it,<br>
  embracing his aloneness, realizing<br>
  he is one with the whole universe.<br>

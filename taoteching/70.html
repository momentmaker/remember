<div id="c70">
  My teachings are easy to understand<br>
  and easy to put into practice.<br>
  Yet your intellect will never grasp them,<br>
  and if you try to practice them, you'll fail.<br>
  <br>
  My teachings are older than the world.<br>
  How can you grasp their meaning?<br>
  <br>
  If you want to know me,<br>
  look inside your heart.<br>

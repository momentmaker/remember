<div id="c23">
  Express yourself completely,<br>
  then keep quiet.<br>
  Be like the forces of nature:<br>
  when it blows, there is only wind;<br>
  when it rains, there is only rain;<br>
  when the clouds pass, the sun shines through.<br>
  <br>
  If you open yourself to the Tao,<br>
  you are at one with the Tao<br>
  and you can embody it completely.<br>
  If you open yourself to insight,<br>
  you are at one with insight<br>
  and you can use it completely.<br>
  If you open yourself to loss,<br>
  you are at one with loss<br>
  and you can accept it completely.<br>
  <br>
  Open yourself to the Tao,<br>
  then trust your natural responses;<br>
  and everything will fall into place.<br>

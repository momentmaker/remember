<div id="t66">
  All streams flow to the sea<br>
  because it is lower than they are.<br>
  Humility gives it its power.<br>
  <br>
  If you want to govern the people,<br>
  you must place yourself below them.<br>
  If you want to lead the people,<br>
  you must learn how to follow them.<br>
  <br>
  The Master is above the people,<br>
  and no one feels oppressed.<br>
  She goes ahead of the people,<br>
  and no one feels manipulated.<br>
  The whole world is grateful to her.<br>
  Because she competes with no one,<br>
  no one can compete with her.<br>

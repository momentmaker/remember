<div id="t2">
  When people see some things as beautiful,<br>
  other things become ugly.<br>
  When people see some things as good,<br>
  other things become bad.<br>
  <br>
  Being and non-being create each other.<br>
  Difficult and easy support each other.<br>
  Long and short define each other.<br>
  High and low depend on each other.<br>
  Before and after follow each other.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore the Master<br>
  acts without doing anything<br>
  and teaches without saying anything.<br>
  Things arise and she lets them come;<br>
  things disappear and she lets them go.<br>
  She has but doesn't possess,<br>
  acts but doesn't expect.<br>
  When her work is done, she forgets it.<br>
  That is why it lasts forever.<br>

<div id="c8">
  The supreme good is like water,<br>
  which nourishes all things without trying to.<br>
  It is content with the low places that people disdain.<br>
  Thus it is like the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  In dwelling, live close to the ground.<br>
  In thinking, keep to the simple.<br>
  In conflict, be fair and generous.<br>
  In governing, don't try to control.<br>
  In work, do what you enjoy.<br>
  In family life, be completely present.<br>
  <br>
  When you are content to be simply yourself<br>
  and don't compare or compete,<br>
  everybody will respect you.<br>

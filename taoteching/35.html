<div id="t35">
  She who is centered in the Tao<br>
  can go where she wishes, without danger.<br>
  She perceives the universal harmony,<br>
  even amid great pain,<br>
  because she has found peace in her heart.<br>
  <br>
  Music or the smell of good cooking<br>
  may make people stop and enjoy.<br>
  But words that point to the Tao<br>
  seem monotonous and without flavor.<br>
  When you look for it, there is nothing to see.<br>
  When you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.<br>
  When you use it, it is inexhaustible.<br>

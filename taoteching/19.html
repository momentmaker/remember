<div id="c19">
  Throw away holiness and wisdom,<br>
  and people will be a hundred times happier.<br>
  Throw away morality and justice,<br>
  and people will do the right thing.<br>
  Throw away industry and profit,<br>
  and there won't be any thieves.<br>
  <br>
  If these three aren't enough,<br>
  just stay at the center of the circle<br>
  and let all things take their course.<br>
</div>

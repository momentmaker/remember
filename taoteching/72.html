<div id="c72">
  When they lose their sense of awe,<br>
  people turn to religion.<br>
  When they no longer trust themselves,<br>
  they begin to depend upon authority.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore the Master steps back<br>
  so that people won't be confused.<br>
  He teaches without a teaching,<br>
  so that people will have nothing to learn.<br>

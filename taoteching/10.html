<div id="c10">
  Can you coax your mind from its wandering<br>
  and keep to the original oneness?<br>
  Can you let your body become<br>
  supple as a newborn child's?<br>
  Can you cleanse your inner vision<br>
  until you see nothing but the light?<br>
  Can you love people and lead them<br>
  without imposing your will?<br>
  Can you deal with the most vital matters<br>
  by letting events take their course?<br>
  Can you step back from you own mind<br>
  and thus understand all things?<br>
  <br>
  Giving birth and nourishing,<br>
  having without possessing,<br>
  acting with no expectations,<br>
  leading and not trying to control:<br>
  this is the supreme virtue.<br>
</div>

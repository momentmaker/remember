<div id="t74">
  If you realize that all things change,<br>
  there is nothing you will try to hold on to.<br>
  If you aren't afraid of dying,<br>
  there is nothing you can't achieve.<br>
  <br>
  Trying to control the future<br>
  is like trying to take the master carpenter's place.<br>
  When you handle the master carpenter's tools,<br>
  chances are that you'll cut your hand.<br>

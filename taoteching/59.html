<div id="t59">
  For governing a country well<br>
  there is nothing better than moderation.<br>
  <br>
  The mark of a moderate man<br>
  is freedom from his own ideas.<br>
  Tolerant like the sky,<br>
  all-pervading like sunlight,<br>
  firm like a mountain,<br>
  supple like a tree in the wind,<br>
  he has no destination in view<br>
  and makes use of anything<br>
  life happens to bring his way.<br>
  <br>
  Nothing is impossible for him.<br>
  Because he has let go,<br>
  he can care for the people's welfare<br>
  as a mother cares for her child.<br>

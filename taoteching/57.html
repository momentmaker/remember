<div id="t57">
  If you want to be a great leader,<br>
  you must learn to follow the Tao.<br>
  Stop trying to control.<br>
  Let go of fixed plans and concepts,<br>
  and the world will govern itself.<br>
  <br>
  The more prohibitions you have,<br>
  the less virtuous people will be.<br>
  The more weapons you have,<br>
  the less secure people will be.<br>
  The more subsidies you have,<br>
  the less self-reliant people will be.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore the Master says:<br>
  I let go of the law,<br>
  and people become honest.<br>
  I let go of economics,<br>
  and people become prosperous.<br>
  I let go of religion,<br>
  and people become serene.<br>
  I let go of all desire for the common good,<br>
  and the good becomes common as grass.<br>

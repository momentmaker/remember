<div id="t53">
  The great Way is easy,<br>
  yet people prefer the side paths.<br>
  Be aware when things are out of balance.<br>
  Stay centered within the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  When rich speculators prosper<br>
  While farmers lose their land;<br>
  when government officials spend money<br>
  on weapons instead of cures;<br>
  when the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible<br>
  while the poor have nowhere to turn-<br>
  all this is robbery and chaos.<br>
  It is not in keeping with the Tao.<br>

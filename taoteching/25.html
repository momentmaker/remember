<div id="c25">
  There was something formless and perfect<br>
  before the universe was born.<br>
  It is serene. Empty.<br>
  Solitary. Unchanging.<br>
  Infinite. Eternally present.<br>
  It is the mother of the universe.<br>
  For lack of a better name,<br>
  I call it the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  It flows through all things,<br>
  inside and outside, and returns<br>
  to the origin of all things.<br>
  <br>
  The Tao is great.<br>
  The universe is great.<br>
  Earth is great.<br>
  Man is great.<br>
  These are the four great powers.<br>
  <br>
  Man follows the earth.<br>
  Earth follows the universe.<br>
  The universe follows the Tao.<br>
  The Tao follows only itself.<br>

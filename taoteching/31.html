<div id="t31">
  Weapons are the tools of violence;<br>
  all decent men detest them.<br>
  <br>
  Weapons are the tools of fear;<br>
  a decent man will avoid them<br>
  except in the direst necessity<br>
  and, if compelled, will use them<br>
  only with the utmost restraint.<br>
  Peace is his highest value.<br>
  If the peace has been shattered,<br>
  how can he be content?<br>
  His enemies are not demons,<br>
  but human beings like himself.<br>
  He doesn't wish them personal harm.<br>
  Nor does he rejoice in victory.<br>
  How could he rejoice in victory<br>
  and delight in the slaughter of men?<br>
  <br>
  He enters a battle gravely,<br>
  with sorrow and with great compassion,<br>
  as if he were attending a funeral.<br>

  A good traveler has no fixed plans<br>
  and is not intent upon arriving.<br>
  A good artist lets his intuition<br>
  lead him wherever it wants.<br>
  A good scientist has freed himself of concepts<br>
  and keeps his mind open to what is.<br>
  <br>
  Thus the Master is available to all people<br>
  and doesn't reject anyone.<br>
  He is ready to use all situations<br>
  and doesn't waste anything.<br>
  This is called embodying the light.<br>
  <br>
  What is a good man but a bad man's teacher?<br>
  What is a bad man but a good man's job?<br>
  If you don't understand this, you will get lost,<br>
  however intelligent you are.<br>
  It is the great secret.<br>

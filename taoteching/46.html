<div id="c46">
  When a country is in harmony with the Tao,<br>
  the factories make trucks and tractors.<br>
  When a country goes counter to the Tao,<br>
  warheads are stockpiled outside the cities.<br>
  <br>
  There is no greater illusion than fear,<br>
  no greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself,<br>
  no greater misfortune than having an enemy.<br>
  <br>
  Whoever can see through all fear<br>
  will always be safe.<br>
</div>

<div id="c58">
  If a country is governed with tolerance,<br>
  the people are comfortable and honest.<br>
  If a country is governed with repression,<br>
  the people are depressed and crafty.<br>
  <br>
  When the will to power is in charge,<br>
  the higher the ideals, the lower the results.<br>
  Try to make people happy,<br>
  and you lay the groundwork for misery.<br>
  Try to make people moral,<br>
  and you lay the groundwork for vice.<br>
  <br>
  Thus the Master is content<br>
  to serve as an example<br>
  and not to impose her will.<br>
  She is pointed, but doesn't pierce.<br>
  Straightforward, but supple.<br>
  Radiant, but easy on the eyes.<br>

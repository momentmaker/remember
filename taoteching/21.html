<div id="c21">
  The Master keeps her mind<br>
  always at one with the Tao;<br>
  that is what gives her her radiance.<br>
  <br>
  The Tao is ungraspable.<br>
  How can her mind be at one with it?<br>
  Because she doesn't cling to ideas.<br>
  <br>
  The Tao is dark and unfathomable.<br>
  How can it make her radiant?<br>
  Because she lets it.<br>
  <br>
  Since before time and space were,<br>
  the Tao is.<br>
  It is beyond is and is not.<br>
  How do I know this is true?<br>
  I look inside myself and see.<br>

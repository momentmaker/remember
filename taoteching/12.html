<div id="c12">
  Colors blind the eye.<br>
  Sounds deafen the ear.<br>
  Flavors numb the taste.<br>
  Thoughts weaken the mind.<br>
  Desires wither the heart.<br>
  <br>
  The Master observes the world<br>
  but trusts his inner vision.<br>
  He allows things to come and go.<br>
  His heart is open as the sky.<br>

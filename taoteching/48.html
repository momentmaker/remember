<div id="t48">
  In pursuit of knowledge,<br>
  every day something is added.<br>
  In the practice of the Tao,<br>
  every day something is dropped.<br>
  Less and less do you need to force things,<br>
  until finally you arrive at non-action.<br>
  When nothing is done,<br>
  nothing is left undone.<br>
  <br>
  True mastery can be gained<br>
  by letting things go their own way.<br>
  It can't be gained by interfering.<br>

<div id="t51">
  Every being in the universe<br>
  is an expression of the Tao.<br>
  It springs into existence,<br>
  unconscious, perfect, free,<br>
  takes on a physical body,<br>
  lets circumstances complete it.<br>
  That is why every being<br>
  spontaneously honors the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  The Tao gives birth to all beings,<br>
  nourishes them, maintains them,<br>
  cares for them, comforts them, protects them,<br>
  takes them back to itself,<br>
  creating without possessing,<br>
  acting without expecting,<br>
  guiding without interfering.<br>
  That is why love of the Tao<br>
  is in the very nature of things.<br>

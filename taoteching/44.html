<div id="c44">
  Fame or integrity: which is more important?<br>
  Money or happiness: which is more valuable?<br>
  Success of failure: which is more destructive?<br>
  <br>
  If you look to others for fulfillment,<br>
  you will never truly be fulfilled.<br>
  If your happiness depends on money,<br>
  you will never be happy with yourself.<br>
  <br>
  Be content with what you have;<br>
  rejoice in the way things are.<br>
  When you realize there is nothing lacking,<br>
  the whole world belongs to you.<br>

<div id="c22">
  If you want to become whole,<br>
  let yourself be partial.<br>
  If you want to become straight,<br>
  let yourself be crooked.<br>
  If you want to become full,<br>
  let yourself be empty.<br>
  If you want to be reborn,<br>
  let yourself die.<br>
  If you want to be given everything,<br>
  give everything up.<br>
  <br>
  The Master, by residing in the Tao,<br>
  sets an example for all beings.<br>
  Because he doesn't display himself,<br>
  people can see his light.<br>
  Because he has nothing to prove,<br>
  people can trust his words.<br>
  Because he doesn't know who he is,<br>
  people recognize themselves in him.<br>
  Because he has no goad in mind,<br>
  everything he does succeeds.<br>
  <br>
  When the ancient Masters said,<br>
  "If you want to be given everything,<br>
  give everything up,"<br>
  they weren't using empty phrases.<br>
  Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.<br>

<div id="t47">
  Without opening your door,<br>
  you can open your heart to the world.<br>
  Without looking out your window,<br>
  you can see the essence of the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  The more you know,<br>
  the less you understand.<br>
  <br>
  The Master arrives without leaving,<br>
  sees the light without looking,<br>
  achieves without doing a thing.<br>

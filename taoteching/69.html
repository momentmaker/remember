  The generals have a saying:<br>
  "Rather than make the first move<br>
  it is better to wait and see.<br>
  Rather than advance an inch<br>
  it is better to retreat a yard."<br>
  <br>
  This is called<br>
  going forward without advancing,<br>
  pushing back without using weapons.<br>
  <br>
  There is no greater misfortune<br>
  than underestimating your enemy.<br>
  Underestimating your enemy<br>
  means thinking that he is evil.<br>
  Thus you destroy your three treasures<br>
  and become an enemy yourself.<br>
  <br>
  When two great forces oppose each other,<br>
  the victory will go<br>
  to the one that knows how to yield.<br>

<div id="c24">
  He who stands on tiptoe<br>
  doesn't stand form.<br>
  He who rushes ahead<br>
  doesn't go far.<br>
  He who tries to shine<br>
  dims his own light.<br>
  He who defines himself<br>
  can't know who he really is.<br>
  He who has power over others<br>
  can't empower himself.<br>
  He who clings to his work<br>
  will create nothing that endures.<br>
  <br>
  If you want to accord with the Tao,<br>
  just do your job, then let go.<br>
</div>

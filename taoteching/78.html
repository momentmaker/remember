<div id="c78">
  Nothing in the world<br>
  is as soft and yielding as water.<br>
  Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,<br>
  nothing can surpass it.<br>
  <br>
  The soft overcomes the hard;<br>
  the gentle overcomes the rigid.<br>
  Everyone knows this is true,<br>
  but few can put it into practice.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore the Master remains<br>
  serene in the midst of sorrow.<br>
  Evil cannot enter his heart.<br>
  Because he has given up helping,<br>
  he is people's greatest help.<br>
  <br>
  True words seem paradoxical.<br>

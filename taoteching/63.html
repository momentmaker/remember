<div id="t63">
  Act without doing;<br>
  work without effort.<br>
  Think of the small as large<br>
  and the few as many.<br>
  Confront the difficult<br>
  while it is still easy;<br>
  accomplish the great task<br>
  by a series of small acts.<br>
  <br>
  The Master never reaches for the great;<br>
  thus she achieves greatness.<br>
  When she runs into a difficulty,<br>
  she stops and gives herself to it.<br>
  She doesn't cling to her own comfort;<br>
  thus problems are no problem for her.<br>

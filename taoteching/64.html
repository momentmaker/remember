  What is rooted is easy to nourish.<br>
  What is recent is easy to correct.<br>
  What is brittle is easy to break.<br>
  What is small is easy to scatter.<br>
  <br>
  Prevent trouble before it arises.<br>
  Put things in order before they exist.<br>
  The giant pine tree<br>
  grows from a tiny sprout.<br>
  The journey of a thousand miles<br>
  starts from beneath your feet.<br>
  <br>
  Rushing into action, you fail.<br>
  Trying to grasp things, you lose them.<br>
  Forcing a project to completion,<br>
  you ruin what was almost ripe.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore the Master takes action<br>
  by letting things take their course.<br>
  He remains as calm<br>
  at the end as at the beginning.<br>
  He has nothing,<br>
  thus has nothing to lose.<br>
  What he desires is non-desire;<br>
  what he learns is to unlearn.<br>
  He simply reminds people<br>
  of who they have always been.<br>
  He cares about nothing but the Tao.<br>
  Thus he can care for all things.<br>

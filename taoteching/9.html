<div id="t9">
  Fill your bowl to the brim<br>
  and it will spill.<br>
  Keep sharpening your knife<br>
  and it will blunt.<br>
  Chase after money and security<br>
  and your heart will never unclench.<br>
  Care about people's approval<br>
  and you will be their prisoner.<br>
  <br>
  Do your work, then step back.<br>
  The only path to serenity.<br>
</div>

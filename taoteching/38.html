<div id="t38">
  The Master doesn't try to be powerful;<br>
  thus he is truly powerful.<br>
  The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;<br>
  thus he never has enough.<br>
  <br>
  The Master does nothing,<br>
  yet he leaves nothing undone.<br>
  The ordinary man is always doing things,<br>
  yet many more are left to be done.<br>
  <br>
  The kind man does something,<br>
  yet something remains undone.<br>
  The just man does something,<br>
  and leaves many things to be done.<br>
  The moral man does something,<br>
  and when no one responds<br>
  he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.<br>
  <br>
  When the Tao is lost, there is goodness.<br>
  When goodness is lost, there is morality.<br>
  When morality is lost, there is ritual.<br>
  Ritual is the husk of true faith,<br>
  the beginning of chaos.<br>
  <br>
  Therefore the Master concerns himself<br>
  with the depths and not the surface,<br>
  with the fruit and not the flower.<br>
  He has no will of his own.<br>
  He dwells in reality,<br>
  and lets all illusions go.<br>

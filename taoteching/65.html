  The ancient Masters<br>
  didn't try to educate the people,<br>
  but kindly taught them to not-know.<br>
  <br>
  When they think that they know the answers,<br>
  people are difficult to guide.<br>
  When they know that they don't know,<br>
  people can find their own way.<br>
  <br>
  If you want to learn how to govern,<br>
  avoid being clever or rich.<br>
  The simplest pattern is the clearest.<br>
  Content with an ordinary life,<br>
  you can show all people the way<br>
  back to their own true nature.<br>

<div id="c62">
  The Tao is the center of the universe,<br>
  the good man's treasure,<br>
  the bad man's refuge.<br>
  <br>
  Honors can be bought with fine words,<br>
  respect can be won with good deeds;<br>
  but the Tao is beyond all value,<br>
  and no one can achieve it.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, when a new leader is chosen,<br>
  don't offer to help him<br>
  with your wealth or your expertise.<br>
  Offer instead<br>
  to teach him about the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  Why did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?<br>
  Because, being one with the Tao,<br>
  when you seek, you find;<br>
  and when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.<br>
  That is why everybody loves it.<br>

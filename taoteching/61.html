<div id="c61">
  When a country obtains great power,<br>
  it becomes like the sea:<br>
  all streams run downward into it.<br>
  The more powerful it grows,<br>
  the greater the need for humility.<br>
  Humility means trusting the Tao,<br>
  thus never needing to be defensive.<br>
  <br>
  A great nation is like a great man:<br>
  When he makes a mistake, he realizes it.<br>
  Having realized it, he admits it.<br>
  Having admitted it, he corrects it.<br>
  He considers those who point out his faults<br>
  as his most benevolent teachers.<br>
  He thinks of his enemy<br>
  as the shadow that he himself casts.<br>
  <br>
  If a nation is centered in the Tao,<br>
  if it nourishes its own people<br>
  and doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,<br>
  it will be a light to all nations in the world.<br>

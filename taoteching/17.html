<div id="t17">
  When the Master governs, the people<br>
  are hardly aware that he exists.<br>
  Next best is a leader who is loved.<br>
  Next, one who is feared.<br>
  The worst is one who is despised.<br>
  <br>
  If you don't trust the people,<br>
  you make them untrustworthy.<br>
  <br>
  The Master doesn't talk, he acts.<br>
  When his work is done,<br>
  the people say, "Amazing:<br>
  we did it, all by ourselves!"<br>

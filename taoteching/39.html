<div id="c39">
  In harmony with the Tao,<br>
  the sky is clear and spacious,<br>
  the earth is solid and full,<br>
  all creature flourish together,<br>
  content with the way they are,<br>
  endlessly repeating themselves,<br>
  endlessly renewed.<br>
  <br>
  When man interferes with the Tao,<br>
  the sky becomes filthy,<br>
  the earth becomes depleted,<br>
  the equilibrium crumbles,<br>
  creatures become extinct.<br>
  <br>
  The Master views the parts with compassion,<br>
  because he understands the whole.<br>
  His constant practice is humility.<br>
  He doesn't glitter like a jewel<br>
  but lets himself be shaped by the Tao,<br>
  as rugged and common as stone.<br>

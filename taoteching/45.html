<div id="c45">
  True perfection seems imperfect,<br>
  yet it is perfectly itself.<br>
  True fullness seems empty,<br>
  yet it is fully present.<br>
  <br>
  True straightness seems crooked.<br>
  True wisdom seems foolish.<br>
  True art seems artless.<br>
  <br>
  The Master allows things to happen.<br>
  She shapes events as they come.<br>
  She steps out of the way<br>
  and lets the Tao speak for itself.<br>

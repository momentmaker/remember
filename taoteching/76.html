<div id="c76">
  Men are born soft and supple;<br>
  dead, they are stiff and hard.<br>
  Plats are born tender and pliant;<br>
  dead, they are brittle and dry.<br>
  <br>
  Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible<br>
  is a disciple of death.<br>
  Whoever is soft and yielding<br>
  is a disciple of life.<br>
  <br>
  The hard and stiff will be broken.<br>
  The soft and supple will prevail.<br>

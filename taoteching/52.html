<div id="t52">
  In the beginning was the Tao.<br>
  All things issue from it;<br>
  all things return to it.<br>
  <br>
  To find the origin,<br>
  trace back the manifestations.<br>
  When you recognize the children<br>
  and find the mother,<br>
  you will be free of sorrow.<br>
  <br>
  If you close your mind in judgements<br>
  and traffic with desires,<br>
  your heart will be troubled.<br>
  If you keep your mind from judging<br>
  and aren't led by the senses,<br>
  your heart will find peace.<br>
  <br>
  Seeing into darkness is clarity.<br>
  Knowing how to yield is strength.<br>
  Use your own light<br>
  and return to the source of light.<br>
  This is called practicing eternity.<br>

<div id="c60">
  Governing a large country<br>
  is like frying a small fish.<br>
  You spoil it with too much poking.<br>
  <br>
  Center your country in the Tao<br>
  and evil will have no power.<br>
  Not that it isn't there,<br>
  but you'll be able to step out of its way.<br>
  <br>
  Give evil nothing to oppose<br>
  and it will disappear by itself.<br>
</div>

<div id="t29">
  Do you want to improve the world?<br>
  I don't think it can be done.<br>
  <br>
  The world is sacred.<br>
  It can't be improved.<br>
  If you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.<br>
  If you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.<br>
  <br>
  There is a time for being ahead,<br>
  a time for being behind;<br>
  a time for being in motion,<br>
  a time for being at rest;<br>
  a time for being vigorous,<br>
  a time for being exhausted;<br>
  a time for being safe,<br>
  a time for being in danger.<br>
  <br>
  The Master sees things as they are,<br>
  without trying to control them.<br>
  She lets them go their own way,<br>
  and resides at the center of the circle.<br>

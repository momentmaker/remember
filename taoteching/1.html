<div id="c1">
  The tao that can be told<br>
  is not the eternal Tao<br>
  The name that can be named<br>
  is not the eternal Name.<br>
  <br>
  The unnamable is the eternally real.<br>
  Naming is the origin<br>
  of all particular things.<br>
  <br>
  Free from desire, you realize the mystery.<br>
  Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations.<br>
  <br>
  Yet mystery and manifestations<br>
  arise from the same source.<br>
  This source is called darkness.<br>
  <br>
  Darkness within darkness.<br>
  The gateway to all understanding.<br>

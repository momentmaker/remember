<div id="t20">
  Stop thinking, and end your problems.<br>
  What difference between yes and no?<br>
  What difference between success and failure?<br>
  Must you value what others value,<br>
  avoid what others avoid?<br>
  How ridiculous!<br>
  <br>
  Other people are excited,<br>
  as though they were at a parade.<br>
  I alone don't care,<br>
  I alone am expressionless,<br>
  like an infant before it can smile.<br>
  <br>
  Other people have what they need;<br>
  I alone possess nothing.<br>
  I alone drift about,<br>
  like someone without a home.<br>
  I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.<br>
  <br>
  Other people are bright;<br>
  I alone am dark.<br>
  Other people are sharper;<br>
  I alone am dull.<br>
  Other people have a purpose;<br>
  I alone don't know.<br>
  I drift like a wave on the ocean,<br>
  I blow as aimless as the wind.<br>
  <br>
  I am different from ordinary people.<br>
  I drink from the Great Mother's breasts.<br>

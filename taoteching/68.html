  The best athlete<br>
  wants his opponent at his best.<br>
  The best general<br>
  enters the mind of his enemy.<br>
  The best businessman<br>
  serves the communal good.<br>
  The best leader<br>
  follows the will of the people.<br>
  <br>
  All of the embody<br>
  the virtue of non-competition.<br>
  Not that they don't love to compete,<br>
  but they do it in the spirit of play.<br>
  In this they are like children<br>
  and in harmony with the Tao.<br>

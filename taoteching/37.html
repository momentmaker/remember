<div id="t37">
  The Tao never does anything,<br>
  yet through it all things are done.<br>
  <br>
  If powerful men and women<br>
  could center themselves in it,<br>
  the whole world would be transformed<br>
  by itself, in its natural rhythms.<br>
  People would be content<br>
  with their simple, everyday lives,<br>
  in harmony, and free of desire.<br>
  <br>
  When there is no desire,<br>
  all things are at peace.<br>

<div id="t34">
  The great Tao flows everywhere.<br>
  All things are born from it,<br>
  yet it doesn't create them.<br>
  It pours itself into its work,<br>
  yet it makes no claim.<br>
  It nourishes infinite worlds,<br>
  yet it doesn't hold on to them.<br>
  Since it is merged with all things<br>
  and hidden in their hearts,<br>
  it can be called humble.<br>
  Since all things vanish into it<br>
  and it alone endures,<br>
  it can be called great.<br>
  It isn't aware of its greatness;<br>
  thus it is truly great.<br>
</div>

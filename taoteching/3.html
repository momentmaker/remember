<div id="c3">
  If you overesteem great men,<br>
  people become powerless.<br>
  If you overvalue possessions,<br>
  people begin to steal.<br>
  <br>
  The Master leads<br>
  by emptying people's minds<br>
  and filling their cores,<br>
  by weakening their ambition<br>
  and toughening their resolve.<br>
  He helps people lose everything<br>
  they know, everything they desire,<br>
  and creates confusion<br>
  in those who think that they know.<br>
  <br>
  Practice not-doing,<br>
  and everything will fall into place.<br>

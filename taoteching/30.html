<div id="t30">
  Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men<br>
  doesn't try to force issues<br>
  or defeat enemies by force of arms.<br>
  For every force there is a counterforce.<br>
  Violence, even well intentioned,<br>
  always rebounds upon oneself.<br>
  <br>
  The Master does his job<br>
  and then stops.<br>
  He understands that the universe<br>
  is forever out of control,<br>
  and that trying to dominate events<br>
  goes against the current of the Tao.<br>
  Because he believes in himself,<br>
  he doesn't try to convince others.<br>
  Because he is content with himself,<br>
  he doesn't need others' approval.<br>
  Because he accepts himself,<br>
  the whole world accepts him.<br>

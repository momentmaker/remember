<div id="t15">
  The ancient Masters were profound and subtle.<br>
  Their wisdom was unfathomable.<br>
  There is no way to describe it;<br>
  all we can describe is their appearance.<br>
  <br>
  They were careful<br>
  as someone crossing an iced-over stream.<br>
  Alert as a warrior in enemy territory.<br>
  Courteous as a guest.<br>
  Fluid as melting ice.<br>
  Shapable as a block of wood.<br>
  Receptive as a valley.<br>
  Clear as a glass of water.<br>
  <br>
  Do you have the patience to wait<br>
  till your mud settles and the water is clear?<br>
  Can you remain unmoving<br>
  till the right action arises by itself?<br>
  <br>
  The Master doesn't seek fulfillment.<br>
  Not seeking, not expecting,<br>
  she is present, and can welcome all things.<br>

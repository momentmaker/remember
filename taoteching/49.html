<div id="c49">
  The Master has no mind of her own.<br>
  She works with the mind of the people.<br>
  <br>
  She is good to people who are good.<br>
  She is also good to people who aren't good.<br>
  This is true goodness.<br>
  <br>
  She trusts people who are trustworthy.<br>
  She also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.<br>
  This is true trust.<br>
  <br>
  The Master's mind is like space.<br>
  People don't understand her.<br>
  They look to her and wait.<br>
  She treats them like her own children.<br>

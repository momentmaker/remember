<div id="c41">
  When a superior man hears of the Tao,<br>
  he immediately begins to embody it.<br>
  When an average man hears of the Tao,<br>
  he half believes it, half doubts it.<br>
  When a foolish man hears of the Tao,<br>
  he laughs out loud.<br>
  If he didn't laugh,<br>
  it wouldn't be the Tao.<br>
  <br>
  Thus it is said:<br>
  The path into the light seems dark,<br>
  the path forward seems to go back,<br>
  the direct path seems long,<br>
  true power seems weak,<br>
  true purity seems tarnished,<br>
  true steadfastness seems changeable,<br>
  true clarity seems obscure,<br>
  the greatest art seems unsophisticated,<br>
  the greatest love seems indifferent,<br>
  the greatest wisdom seems childish.<br>
  <br>
  The Tao is nowhere to be found.<br>
  Yet it nourishes and completes all things.<br>

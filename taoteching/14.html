<div id="t14">
  Look, and it can't be seen.<br>
  Listen, and it can't be heard.<br>
  Reach, and it can't be grasped.<br>
  <br>
  Above, it isn't bright.<br>
  Below, it isn't dark.<br>
  Seamless, unnamable,<br>
  it returns to the realm of nothing.<br>
  Form that includes all forms,<br>
  image without an image,<br>
  subtle, beyond all conception.<br>
  <br>
  Approach it and there is no beginning;<br>
  follow it and there is no end.<br>
  You can't know it, but you can be it,<br>
  at ease in your own life.<br>
  Just realize where you come from:<br>
  this is the essence of wisdom.<br>

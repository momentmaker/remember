<div id="t80">
  If a country is governed wisely,<br>
  its inhabitants will be content.<br>
  They enjoy the labor of their hands<br>
  and don't waste time inventing<br>
  labor-saving machines.<br>
  Since they dearly love their homes,<br>
  they aren't interested in travel.<br>
  There may be a few wagons and boats,<br>
  but these don't go anywhere.<br>
  There may be an arsenal of weapons,<br>
  but nobody ever uses them.<br>
  People enjoy their food,<br>
  take pleasure in being with their families,<br>
  spend weekends working in their gardens,<br>
  delight in the doings of the neighborhood.<br>
  And even though the next country is so close<br>
  that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,<br>
  they are content to die of old age<br>
  without ever having gone to see it.<br>

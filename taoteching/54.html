<div id="c54">
  Whoever is planted in the Tao<br>
  will not be rooted up.<br>
  Whoever embraces the Tao<br>
  will not slip away.<br>
  Her name will be held in honor<br>
  from generation to generation.<br>
  <br>
  Let the Tao be present in your life<br>
  and you will become genuine.<br>
  Let it be present in your family<br>
  and your family will flourish.<br>
  Let it be present in your country<br>
  and your country will be an example<br>
  to all countries in the world.<br>
  Let it be present in the universe<br>
  and the universe will sing.<br>
  <br>
  How do I know this is true?<br>
  By looking inside myself.<br>

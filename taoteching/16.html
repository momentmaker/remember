<div id="t16">
  Empty your mind of all thoughts.<br>
  Let your heart be at peace.<br>
  Watch the turmoil of beings,<br>
  but contemplate their return.<br>
  <br>
  Each separate being in the universe<br>
  returns to the common source.<br>
  Returning to the source is serenity.<br>
  <br>
  If you don't realize the source,<br>
  you stumble in confusion and sorrow.<br>
  When you realize where you come from,<br>
  you naturally become tolerant,<br>
  disinterested, amused,<br>
  kindhearted as a grandmother,<br>
  dignified as a king.<br>
  Immersed in the wonder of the Tao,<br>
  you can deal with whatever life brings you,<br>
  and when death comes, you are ready.<br>
</div>

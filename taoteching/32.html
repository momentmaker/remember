<div id="c32">
  The Tao can't be perceived.<br>
  Smaller than an electron,<br>
  it contains uncountable galaxies.<br>
  <br>
  If powerful men and women<br>
  could remain centered in the Tao,<br>
  all things would be in harmony.<br>
  The world would become a paradise.<br>
  All people would be at peace,<br>
  and the law would be written in their hearts.<br>
  <br>
  When you have names and forms,<br>
  know that they are provisional.<br>
  When you have institutions,<br>
  know where their functions should end.<br>
  Knowing when to stop,<br>
  you can avoid any danger.<br>
  <br>
  All things end in the Tao<br>
  as rivers flow into the sea.<br>

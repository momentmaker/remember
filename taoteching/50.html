<div id="c50">
  The Master gives himself up<br>
  to whatever the moment brings.<br>
  He knows that he is going to die,<br>
  and he has nothing left to hold on to:<br>
  no illusions in his mind,<br>
  no resistances in his body.<br>
  He doesn't think about his actions;<br>
  they flow from the core of his being.<br>
  He holds nothing back from life;<br>
  therefore he is ready for death,<br>
  as a man is ready for sleep<br>
  after a good day's work.<br>

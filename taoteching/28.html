<div id="c28">
  Know the male,<br>
  yet keep to the female:<br>
  receive the world in your arms.<br>
  If you receive the world,<br>
  the Tao will never leave you<br>
  and you will be like a little child.<br>
  <br>
  Know the white,<br>
  yet keep to the black:<br>
  be a pattern for the world.<br>
  If you are a pattern for the world,<br>
  the Tao will be strong inside you<br>
  and there will be nothing you can't do.<br>
  <br>
  Know the personal,<br>
  yet keep to the impersonal:<br>
  accept the world as it is.<br>
  If you accept the world,<br>
  the Tao will be luminous inside you<br>
  and you will return to your primal self.<br>
  <br>
  The world is formed from the void,<br>
  like utensils from a block of wood.<br>
  The Master knows the utensils,<br>
  yet keeps to the block:<br>
  thus she can use all things.<br>

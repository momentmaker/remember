  WORK CAN BE regarded as not having any purpose behind it at all. Instead, it is just work for the sake of working. You
  can experience ignorance or happiness without it being ignorance of something or happiness about something. Likewise,
  work does not need an object. You donâ€™t have to have a particular aim, object, goal, or moralistic sense of
  discipline. You just work because you work. You simply relate with your physical being or your sense of existence as
  part of the work process, which also brings communication with the actual realistic living world.

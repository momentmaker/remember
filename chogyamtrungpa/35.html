<div id="c35">
  SPIRITUALITY does not exist on another level, or on a “higher plane,” quite different from ordinary life, as is
  generally assumed. It is no use trying to be different than you are. Spirituality is not about trying to be something
  more than you are or something better than you are, for that matter. What is known as relative truth, or the truth
  which exists right here, now, in our everyday life, that truth has to be accepted as the general ground, and it is
  also the absolute truth.

  IT WOULD BE FOOLISH to study more advanced subjects before we are familiar with the starting point, the nature of ego.
  Speculations about the goal become mere fantasy. These speculations may take the form of advanced ideas and
  descriptions of spiritual experiences, but they only exploit the weaker aspects of human nature, our expectations and
  desires to see and hear something colorful, something extraordinary. If we begin our study with these dreams of
  extraordinary, “enlightening,” and dramatic experiences, then we will build up our expectations and preconceptions so
  that later, when we are actually working on the path, our minds will be occupied largely with what will be rather than
  with what is. It is destructive and not fair to people to play on their weaknesses, their expectations and dreams,
  rather than to present the realistic starting point of what they are. It is necessary, therefore, to start on what we
  are and why we are searching.

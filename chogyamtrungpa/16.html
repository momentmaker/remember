  THERE HAVE BEEN a number of misconceptions regarding meditation. Some people regard it as a trancelike state of mind.
  Others think of it in terms of training, in the sense of mental gymnastics. But meditation is neither of these,
  although it does involve dealing with neurotic states of mind. The neurotic state of mind is not difficult or
  impossible to deal with. It has energy, speed, and a certain pattern. The practice of meditation involves letting
  beâ€”trying to go with the pattern, trying to go with the energy and the speed. In this way we learn how to deal with
  these factors, how to relate with them, not in the sense of causing them to mature in the way we would like, but in
  the sense of knowing them for what they are and working with their pattern.

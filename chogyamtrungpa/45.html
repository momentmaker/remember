  DISCIPLINE IS NOT a one-shot deal or a two-shot deal, but a one-hundred-thousand shot deal. It happens again and again
  and again. Discipline is not somebody with a long face and a stick. Discipline is somebody without a face, without a
  stick—but cool, cold, fifty degrees below zero. Discipline is not a schoolmaster or a Zen master with a stick in zazen
  practice or a disciplinarian or an angry, hot-tempered tutor. Discipline is not a person at all. That makes it hard to
  relate with, because you can’t rebel against it. You can’t take the stick away from the disciplinarian and hit him
  back. It’s constant discipline. Cool mountain stream. It’s very boring. So let’s call it cool boredom. The boredom
  which such discipline consists of is cool boredom, refreshing boredom.

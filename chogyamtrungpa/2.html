  OUR LIFE is an endless journey. It is like a broad highway that extends infinitely into the distance. The practice of
  meditation provides a vehicle to travel on that road. Our journey consists of constant ups and downs, hope and fear,
  but it is a good journey. The practice of meditation allows us to experience all the textures of the roadway, which is
  what the journey is all about. Through the practice of meditation, we begin to find that within ourselves there is no
  fundamental complaint about anything or anyone at all.

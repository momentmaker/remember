  IF YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT about whether you’re doing the meditation practice right or wrong, it doesn’t matter all that
  much. The main point is to have honesty within yourself. Just do what you think is best. That is called self-truth. If
  truth is understood by oneself, then you cannot be persecuted at all, karmically or any other way. You’re doing your
  best, so what can go wrong? Cheer up and have a good time.

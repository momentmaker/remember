  BUDDHA CAN’T BE AVOIDED. Buddha is everywhere. Enlightenment possibilities are all over the place. Whether you’re
  going to get married tomorrow, whether you’re going to die tomorrow, whatever you may feel, that familiar awake
  quality is everywhere, all the time. From this point of view, everything is a footprint of Buddha, anything that goes
  on, whether we regard it as sublime or ridiculous. Everything we do—breathing, farting, getting mosquito bites, having
  fantastic ideas about reality, thinking clever thoughts, flushing the toilet—whatever occurs is a footprint.

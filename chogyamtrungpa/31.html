  WE MUST WORK with our fears, frustrations, disappointments, and irritations, the painful aspects of life. People
  complain that Buddhism is an extremely gloomy religion because it emphasizes suffering and misery. Usually religions
  speak of beauty, song, ecstasy, bliss. But according to Buddha, we must begin by seeing the experience of life as it
  is. We must see the truth of suffering, the reality of dissatisfaction. We cannot ignore it and attempt to examine
  only the glorious, pleasurable aspects of life. If one searches for a promised land, a Treasure Island, then the
  search only leads to more pain. So all sects and schools of Buddhism agree that we must begin by facing the reality of
  our living situations. We cannot begin by dreaming.

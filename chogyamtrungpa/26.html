  WE GET ANGRY with ourselves, saying, “I could do better than this. What’s wrong with me? I seem to be getting worse.
  I’m going backward.” We’re angry at the whole world, including ourselves. Everything we see is an insult. The universe
  becomes the expression of total insult. One has to relate with that. If you are going to exert your power and energy
  to walk on the path, you have to work with yourself. The first step is to make friends with yourself. That is almost
  the motto of shamatha or mindfulness meditation experience. Making friends with yourself means accepting and
  acknowledging yourself. You work with your subconscious gossip, fantasies, dreams—everything. And everything that you
  learn about yourself you bring back to the technique, to the awareness of the breathing, which was taught by the
  Buddha.

  WHAT IS IMPORTANT is to get beyond the pattern of mental concepts which we have formed. One must learn to be a
  skillful scientist and not accept anything at all. Everything must be seen through one’s own microscope and one has to
  reach one’s own conclusions in one’s own way. Until we do that, there is no savior, no guru, no blessings, and no
  guidance that could be of any help.

  BUDDHISTS TRY TO FOLLOW the example of the Buddha. The Buddha was an Indian prince who decided to abandon his palace
  and his kingdom in order to find out what life is all about. He was looking for the meaning of life, the purpose of
  life. He wanted to know who and what he was. So he went and practiced meditation, and he ate very little. He meditated
  for six years, twenty-four hours a day. And at the end of those six years he discovered something: He realized that
  people don’t have to struggle so much. We don’t have to give in so much to our hassles, our pain, our discomfort.<br>

  The Buddha discovered that there is something in us known as basic goodness. Therefore, we don’t have to condemn
  ourselves for being bad or naughty. The Buddha taught what he had learned to the rest of mankind. What he taught
  then—twenty-five hundred years ago—is still being taught and practiced. The important point for us is to realize that
  we are basically good. Our only problem is that sometimes we don’t actually acknowledge that goodness. We don’t see
  it, so we blame somebody else or we blame ourselves. That is a mistake. We don’t have to blame others, and we don’t
  have to feel nasty or angry. Fundamental goodness is always with us, always in us.

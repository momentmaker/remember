  SHILA, OR DISCIPLINE, is the process of simplifying one’s general life and eliminating unnecessary complications. In
  order to develop a genuine mental discipline, it is first necessary to see how we continually burden ourselves with
  extraneous activities and preoccupations. In Buddhist countries, shila might involve following a particular rule of
  life as a monk or a nun, or adopting the precepts appropriate to a Buddhist layperson. In the Western secular context,
  shila might just involve cultivating an attitude of simplicity toward one’s life in general.

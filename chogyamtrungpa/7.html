  BUDDHA WAS A GREAT REVOLUTIONARY in his way of thinking. He even denied the existence of Brahma, or God, the Creator
  of the world. He determined to accept nothing which he had not first discovered for himself. This does not mean to say
  that he disregarded the great and ancient tradition of India. He respected it very much. His was not an anarchistic
  attitude in any negative sense, nor was it revolutionary in the way the communists are. His was real, positive
  revolution. He developed the creative side of revolution, which is not trying to get help from anyone else, but
  finding out for oneself. By developing such a revolutionary attitude one learns a great deal.

  THE CHALLENGE OF WARRIORSHIP is to live fully in the world as it is and to find within this world, with all its
  paradoxes, the essence of nowness. If we open our eyes, if we open our minds, if we open our hearts, we will find that
  this world is a magical place. It is not magical because it tricks us or changes unexpectedly into something else, but
  it is magical because it can be so vividly, so brilliantly. However, the discovery of that magic can happen only when
  we transcend our embarrassment about being alive, when we have the bravery to proclaim the goodness and dignity of
  human life, without either hesitation or arrogance.

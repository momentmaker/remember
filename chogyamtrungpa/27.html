  THE LIONâ€™S ROAR is the fearless proclamation that any state of mind, including the emotions, is a workable situation,
  a reminder in the practice of meditation. We realize that chaotic situations must not be rejected. Nor should we
  regard them as regressive, as a return to confusion. We must respect whatever happens in our state of mind. Chaos
  should be regarded as extremely good news.

  PEOPLE OFTEN TALK about trying to hold back their tears, but as human beings, we should take pride in our capacity to
  be sad and happy. We mustnâ€™t ignore the preciousness of our human birth or take it for granted. It is extremely
  precious and very powerful. We cannot ignore our basic human endowment.

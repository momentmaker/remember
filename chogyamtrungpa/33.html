  THE TRADITION of Shambhala is like the rising of the sun. When the sun rises, everybody is able to see it. But if
  people are blind, then they are not able to see it. When we say “blind,” we are referring to the setting-sun people,
  those who do not connect with wakefulness. However, the fundamental or ultimate sun lies in the hearts of all people.

  Therefore, everyone possesses fundamental well-being, brilliance, and purity. Whoever a person is, he or she is
  capable of crying, and also capable of laughing. That is the indication that everyone has the Great Eastern Sun within
  them.

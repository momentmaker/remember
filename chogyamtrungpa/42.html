  PERSONAL OPENNESS is the important thing, rather than purely living on faith. Faith can be blind or intelligent. Open
  faith is intelligent, being willing to include one’s confusion and one’s understanding at the same time. Blind faith
  is purely going by facts and figures, thinking in terms of quick results, depending on fame, reputation, and so forth.
  It is like saying you should read a book because this book is a best seller. Five million copies have been sold,
  therefore it must be good. It is possible that five million stupid people bought it and read it. But that’s the kind
  of reference point of blind faith.

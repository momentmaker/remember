  ONE OF THE PROBLEMS we have is that, in relating with the samsaric, confused emotions, we behave like misers; we are
  too frugal. We feel that we have something to lose and something to gain, so we work with the emotions just pinch by
  pinch. But when we work on the wisdom level, we think in terms of greater emotions: greater anger, greater passion,
  greater speed; therefore, we begin to lose our ground and our boundaries. Then we have nothing to fight for.
  Everything is our world, so what is the point of fighting? What is the point of segregating things in terms of this
  and that? The whole thing becomes a larger-scale affair, and egoâ€™s territory seems very cheap, almost inapplicable or
  nonexistent. That is why tantra is called a great feast.

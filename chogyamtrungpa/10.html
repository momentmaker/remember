  THE RECOGNITION of sacredness comes from developing a basic sense of gentleness toward ourselves, so that the
  irritation of being stuck with oneself is taken away. When that kind of friendliness to oneself has occurred, then one
  also develops friendliness toward the rest of the world, at the same time. At that point, sadness, loneliness, and
  wretchedness begin to dissipate. We begin to develop a sense of humor. We donâ€™t get so pissed off if we have a bad cup
  of coffee in the morning. A natural sense of dignity begins to occur.

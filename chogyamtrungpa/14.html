  THE DISCIPLINE of meditation is designed so that everybody can become a good person. Everybody should have a regal
  existence. When you sit on your meditation cushion, donâ€™t hesitate: try to be regal. Synchronize mind and body and try
  to have good physical posture. In meditation, you should keep everything very simple. Work with everything simply and
  directly, keep a good posture, follow the breath, and then project your mind. Let your awareness go out with your
  breath.

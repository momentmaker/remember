  IT IS THROUGH BODY, speech, and mind that we relate with the phenomenal world. Such a relationship is not necessarily
  spiritual; it is physical, bodily. It is a question of being a person of sanity, a person of openness. In fact, we
  could almost approach the whole path in a secular way and call it the nontheistic discipline of developing sanity and
  openness, rather than regarding it as purely a religious tradition.

  WE PREFER to wear sunglasses, rather than facing the brilliance of the sunshine. We put on a hat and sunscreen to
  shield ourselves, fearing that we might get burned. The colorfulness of relationships, household chores, business
  enterprises, and our general livelihood are too irritating. We are constantly looking for padding so that we donâ€™t run
  into the sharp edges of the world. That is the essence of wrong belief. It is an obstacle to seeing the wisdom of the
  Great Eastern Sun, which is seeing greater vision beyond our own small world.

  WE HAVE A FEAR of facing ourselves. That is the obstacle. Experiencing the innermost core of our existence is very
  embarrassing to a lot of people. A lot of people turn to something that they hope will liberate them without their
  having to face themselves. That is impossible. We canâ€™t do that. We have to be honest with ourselves. We have to see
  our gut, our excrement, our most undesirable parts. We have to see them. That is the foundation of warriorship,
  basically speaking. Whatever is there, we have to face it, we have to look at it, study it, work with it, and practice
  meditation with it.

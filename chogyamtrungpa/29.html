  BOREDOM IS IMPORTANT in meditation practice; it increases the psychological sophistication of the practitioners. They
  begin to appreciate boredom and they develop their sophistication until the boredom begins to become cool boredom,
  like a mountain river. It flows and flows and flows, methodically and repetitiously, but it is very cooling, very
  refreshing. Mountains never get tired of being mountains, and waterfalls never get tired of being waterfalls. Because
  of their patience we begin to appreciate them. There is something in that. If we are to save ourselves from spiritual
  materialism and from buddhadharma with credentials, or dogma, if we are to become the dharma without credentials, the
  introduction of boredom and repetitiousness is extremely important.

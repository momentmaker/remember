  THE HAPPENINGS OF LIFE are manifestations of energy. This energy in the situations of life is a very powerful teacher.
  If you go too far, in the sense of not being receptive enough to learn from the experience of life, if you ignore this
  experience and go too far with the extreme emotional excitement of ego, then sooner or later you are going to be
  pulled back. This might take the form of accident, illness, or disaster—any sort of chaos. Whereas if you are able to
  see the first signal that you have lost touch with the life situation as teacher, then you will be able to tune
  yourself back into it. That is “guru-as-environment.”

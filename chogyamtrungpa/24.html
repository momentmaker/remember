  TAKING THE mahayana approach of benevolence means giving up privacy and developing a sense of greater vision. Rather
  than focusing on our own little projects, we expand our vision immensely to embrace working with the rest of the
  world, the rest of the galaxies, the rest of the universes. Putting such broad vision into practice requires that we
  relate to situations very clearly and perfectly.<br>
  <br>
  In order to drop our self-centeredness, which both limits our view and clouds our actions, it is necessary for us to
  develop a sense of compassion. Traditionally this is done by first developing compassion toward oneself, then toward
  someone very close to us, and finally toward all sentient beings, including our enemies. Ultimately we regard all
  sentient beings with as much emotional involvement as if they were our own mothers. We may not require such a
  traditional approach at this point, but we can develop some sense of ongoing openness and gentleness.

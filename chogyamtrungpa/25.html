  TRUE SPIRITUALITY is not a battle; it is the ultimate practice of nonviolence. We are not regarding any part of us as
  being a villain, an enemy, but we are trying to use everything as a part of the natural process of life. As soon as a
  notion of polarity, of good and bad develops, then we are caught in spiritual materialism, which is working to achieve
  happiness in a simple-minded sense, on the way to egohood.

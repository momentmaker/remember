  MEDITATION is the only way to relate with neurosis and self-deception. In this case, meditation does not mean
  concentrating on objects or trying to intensify certain psychic faculties or anything of that nature. It is simply
  creating a space, a space in which we can unlearn and undo our subconscious gossip, our hidden fears and hidden hopes,
  and begin to bring them out. Meditation is simply providing space through the discipline of sitting down and doing
  nothing. Doing nothing is extremely difficult. At the beginning we can only try to do nothing by imitating doing
  nothing. And then hopefully we can develop gradually from there.

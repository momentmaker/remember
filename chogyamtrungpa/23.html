  SHAMATHA MEDITATION practice is the development of mindfulness, paying attention to what is happening. Mainly this is
  working with your breath, your ordinary breathing. For example, if you’ve been exerting yourself, when you sit down to
  rest, you pay attention to your breathing. You walk toward your place of relaxation, and then, as you sit down, you
  say “phew.” Breathing plays a very important part in ordinary common experience. Natural breathing, natural
  situations: that is the first thing that we can touch in terms of relaxation and peace.

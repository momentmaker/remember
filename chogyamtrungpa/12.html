  VERY BEAUTIFUL SITUATIONS have developed using chaos as part of the enlightened approach. There is chaos of all kinds
  developing all the time: psychological disorder, social disorder, metaphysical disorder, or physical disorder,
  constantly happening. If you are trying to stop those situations, you are looking for external means of liberating
  yourself, another answer. But if we are able to look into the basic situation, then chaos is the inspiration,
  confusion is the inspiration.

  IN THE FUNDAMENTAL SENSE, Buddhist meditation does not involve meditating on anything. You simply arouse your sense of
  wakefulness and hold an excellent posture. You hold up your head and shoulders and sit cross-legged. Then very simply,
  you relate to the basic notion of body, speech, and mind, and you focus your awareness in some way, usually using the
  breath. You are breathing out and in, and you just experience that breathing very naturally. Your breath is not
  considered either holy or evil; it is just breath.

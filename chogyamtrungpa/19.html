  THE MIND is like a crazy monkey, which leaps about and never stays in one place. It is completely restless and
  constantly paranoid about its surroundings. The training, or the meditation practice, is a way to catch the monkey, to
  begin with. That is the starting point. Traditionally, this training is called shamatha in Sanskrit, or shi-ne in
  Tibetan, which means simply “the development of peace.” When we talk about the development of peace, we are not
  talking about cultivating a peaceful state, as such, but about simplicity.

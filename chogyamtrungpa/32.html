  EVEN THOUGH somebody else has made a terrible boo-boo and blamed it on you, you should take the blame yourself. You
  can actually say: “Okay, the blame is mine.” Once you begin to do that, it is the highest and most powerful logic, the
  most powerful incantation you can make. You can absorb the poison—then the rest of the situation becomes medicine. If
  nobody is willing to absorb the blame, it becomes a big international football. Everybody tries to pass it on to each
  other and nothing happens. As far as international politics is concerned, somebody is always trying to put the blame
  on somebody else, to pass that huge, overbuilt, gooey, dirty, smelly, gigantic football with all sort of worms coming
  out of it. People say, “It’s not mine, it’s yours.” So even from the point of view of political theory—if there is
  such a thing as politics in Buddhism—it is important for individuals to absorb unjustified blame and to work with
  that. It is very important and necessary.

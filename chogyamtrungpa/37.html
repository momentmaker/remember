  THE TERM MAITRI, loving-kindness, or even compassion, is generally rather sentimental and weak in the English
  language. It has certain connotations connected with the popular concept of charity and being kind to our neighbors.
  The real concept of maitri is different from that. In part, of course, it does involve a sentimental approach, since
  there is always room for the emotions. However, maitri is not just being kind and nice. It is the understanding that
  one has to become one with the situation. That does not mean that one becomes entirely without personality and has to
  just accept whatever the other person suggests. Rather, one has to overcome the barrier that one has formed between
  oneself and others. If you remove this barrier and open yourself, then automatically real understanding and clarity
  will develop in your mind.

<div id="c30">
  THIS LIFE is very valuable. Human birth is very important. You have a chance to practice, a chance to learn the truth,
  and still the question of “Why bother?” keeps cropping up again and again. You see, the path actually consists of “Who
  am I? What am I? What is this? What isn’t this?” all the time until enlightenment is actually achieved. The question
  “Why bother?” has never been answered. It becomes one of the mantras of the path. “Why bother?” goes on all the time.

  THE ESSENCE OF COWARDICE is not acknowledging the reality of fear. Fear can take many forms. Logically, we know we
  can’t live forever. We are petrified of our death. On another level, we are afraid that we can’t handle the demands of
  the world. This fear expresses itself as a feeling of inadequacy. We feel that our own lives are overwhelming, and
  confronting the rest of the world is more overwhelming. Then there is abrupt fear, or panic, that arises when new
  situations occur suddenly in our lives. When we feel that we can’t handle them, we jump or twitch. Sometimes fear
  manifests in the form of restlessness: doodles on a notepad, playing with our fingers, or fidgeting in our chairs. We
  feel that we have to keep ourselves moving all the time, like an engine running in a motorcar. The pistons go up and
  down, up and down. As long as the pistons keep moving, we feel safe. Otherwise, we are afraid we might die on the
  spot.

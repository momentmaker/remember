  MONEY IS basically a very simple thing. But our attitude toward it is overloaded, full of preconceived ideas that stem
  from the development of a self-aggrandizing ego and its manipulative processes. The mere act of handling money—just
  pieces of paper—is viewed as a very serious game. The energy money takes on makes a tremendous difference in the
  process of communication and relationship. If a friend suddenly refuses to pay his check at a restaurant, a feeling of
  resentment or separation automatically arises in relation to him. If one buys a friend a cup of tea—which is just a
  cup, hot water, and tea—somehow a factor of meaningfulness gets added.

  It seems to me that it is worthwhile to work with the negative aspects of money in order to gain some understanding
  about ourselves. We must try to discover how to view this embarrassing and potent commodity as a part of ourselves
  that we cannot ignore. When we relate to money properly, it is no longer a mere token of exchange or of our abstract
  energy; it is also a discipline. Then we can deal with it in a practical, earthy way as a master deals with his tools.

  THE PRESERVATION of the past in the present is called memory. We have developed all those memories as possible ways of
  solidifying our existence. Whenever we experience a loss of feeling or a loss of inspiration, we constantly refer back
  to that habitual pattern, which brings us some kind of outdated information. We then try to adapt that outdated
  information to the up-to-date situation, which is a manipulation of the anxiety of the present state. That whole
  process is what’s called “karmic creation.” But this process doesn’t go on into the future at all. The future is a
  virgin situation, completely unoccupied territory. We can’t manipulate the future because nothing has happened in the
  future so far—so the future is a completely open situation.

<div id="c39">
  THE BODY doesn’t have to be special. The whole world is your body. There’s a tendency to view the body as your private
  possession. And because of that, you tend to forget the rest of the world and the greater orbit of experience involved
  with that. If a person is able to relate with the world, he is also able to relate with the body. And if a person is
  able to relate with the body thoroughly, then that person also would learn how to open to the world.

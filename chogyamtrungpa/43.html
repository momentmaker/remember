  A GLIMPSE of buddha nature is not a glimpse in the sense of viewing something: it is a gap rather than a glimpse. That
  gap is the experience that comes out of seeing through the veils of ego. But whether we have a glimpse of it or not,
  the buddha mind is still functioning in us all the time. It occurs in the most bizarre, cheap, and confused styles we
  might present, as well as in whatever extremely profound, dignified, and wise experiences we might have. All of those
  are the expressions of buddha nature.

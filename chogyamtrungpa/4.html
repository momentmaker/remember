  ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED in hearing the dharma, anyone who is interested in finding out about oneself, and anyone who
  is interested in practicing meditation is basically a warrior. The approach of cowardice is looking for some
  tremendous external help, whether it comes from the sky or from the earth. You are afraid of actually seeing yourself;
  therefore you use spirituality or religion as a seeming way of seeing yourself without looking directly at yourself at
  all. Basically, when people are embarrassed about themselves, thereâ€™s no fearlessness involved. Therefore, anybody who
  is interested in looking at oneself, finding out about oneself, and practicing on the spot could be regarded as a
  warrior.
